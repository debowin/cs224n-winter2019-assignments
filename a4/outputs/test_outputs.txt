You know what I do is write for the kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the <unk> for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can feel it as a farmer, or with leather <unk> and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell down somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the <unk> in the middle school in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class of class.
When I went back to bleeding every week in the bathroom <unk> until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret, actually.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years of <unk> I found a lover -- and in the years of <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations who were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> we never get to know us.
You could take it to Ohio and brings that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to do with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We were going to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, <unk> and monitored and took care of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who I wanted to <unk> as an adult arrived at <unk> became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, and it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was made up of itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything for the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I've been talked about a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I took them around the water -- about 60 feet. And I couldn't longer think about a <unk> about another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or they break the ice walls.
Each iceberg has its individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold away up to the end, while others can't afford more, and they get into a <unk> of passionate passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated <unk> and themselves, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg melts -- it's freshwater rich in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they will not be there in that way again.
It's not the death when they're <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
We're just getting to actually see an iceberg <unk>
Here they are.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is there.
This is an iceberg <unk> Day.
It's about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each day, a baby.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception -- I'm not going to pay attention.
So let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined by the X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined by the X <unk> of <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll get back to them later.
In my <unk> it will turn two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the history of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people come up with anatomy -- so human bodies -- how they have considered your body fluids -- the idea of the <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that I performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with identical twins two people inside one body.
I've been working with people with <unk> much higher people than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex <unk> whose physical typology didn't fit into male <unk> and conventional feminine <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't behave in the <unk> or <unk> forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> and tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to it.
This is <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high testosterone levels, but it's not reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops a <unk> course <unk>
When you get the baby <unk> you have a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing their breasts but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After making <unk> you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a y chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most of the women like me -- I consider a female <unk> I don't know his structure -- I think it's a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So sex is something complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old <unk> born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he was wearing a life like a boy and had just figured out that he had ovaries and womb.
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th and the <unk> areolar glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it went to the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies -- that are <unk> identical twins or <unk> or <unk> surgery -- it's not to be able to get away from a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason for the fact that it will be transferred to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up with a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have identity <unk> <unk> being black to say to have African anatomy in <unk> terms.
<unk> <unk>
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine how surprising it is to have children who are born like two people inside one body.
The lowest case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put on trial in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called a lot of reporters called to wonder: "What do you test to figure out whether to <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to tell you the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't traces a sharp line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we have to admit that these categories were very stable categories that were <unk> directly from <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
And also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we get into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we look at the science of science, we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that categories of <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today, not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
And our ancestors had never had to do it with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose and he moved it still not <unk>
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, to take vital organs from a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a dilemma to actually determine death of somebody. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be having someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, giving people with unusual objects, but I have to admit that it gives me nervous.
And so these categories are far more fragile than we were thought to be <unk>
It took away from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find each other and seeing that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why happened in <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were -- to me, the first activists of the anatomy and I explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and they encouraged him with another who was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming into political power by the right of blood passed through the grandfather and then the son, and so on.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They took the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences, that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power <unk> transmitted by a vague idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of Independence is talking about nature and God's God.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They speak about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence they were passing the idea of <unk> coincidence.
And in doing so, they were laid out the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And the women were <unk>
Then he came the movement of the Civil Rights Movement with people of the <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights Movement who said, "I'm a man."
And again, people from color that are <unk> on the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking wonder why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> by anatomy.
I don't want to say that the kids in five years should be allowed to have sexual relationships or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> which for me makes sense and that I think we should be able to support.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
So Henry, in the contrary, I was born at March was born March March <unk>
For the only fact that we were born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sex consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, just by virtue of being considered -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now to be a guy who's been considered to be a legal <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on its hand, does not have the same rights that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So they still do <unk> categories that are <unk> in various ways, and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science took so much in the field of the anatomy that we got to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line on some part, so we're going to do."
But many people are stuck in a rare position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided to marry a man don't have to have chromosome and get married with a woman and have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make people prescribe to people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you to the beginning of the syndrome that <unk>
If you look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech <unk> in his speech to <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in their skin color, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that we should be able to do this for women's rights to people, because I will admit that I know some of the <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more of the social services than some human I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can be able to make more decisions and smart and <unk> about their sexual relations that people from 40 I know.
So how do we put the theme of content <unk>
It turns out.
And one part of me asked what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to make a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed -- unless they're willing to be killed to a change of sex in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of years ago to then pick them up, and so they would take their name.
But when the phone asked her of the operation, he was a very <unk> operation, and he said that in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and therefore they had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of separation <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change the way for the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to finish up I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy would be, or as it could have been, if we had higher participation in the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> -- particularly if there are people thinking in a group.
For years, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the dumbest question I have heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the stereotypes about gender stereotypes -- so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I have thought about your question, the more it has been something like there is female <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female and the male and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I did the <unk> they were very excited to find the way to protect the people in the state, it is possible that they have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make democracy more than <unk> to think about the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So while we're trying to create a more perfect union we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we thought about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where to go to live and work, has the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have a single city to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily reach the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just slept by apartment building.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already were owners and that the other half is still not missing to do it.
You might try to increase the ability to do <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions that build for construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new, new place, building a single apartment building completely new, always and when the rules of that place would turn the construction instead of putting it <unk>
So I proposed that governments were using new large enough zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
They knew that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened for a constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, <unk> <unk> took a platform in which they <unk> reforms and at the same point, reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say you can't go and pick all the current apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of the technologies to <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we sat together in Miami, a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And he used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a charter that <unk> the rules there and a choice so that people can choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I was called and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 3,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The <unk> came up to the platform and said, <unk> <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained the <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option for a city to the one that could go in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away into the North.
And they also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries, could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them establish and make the <unk> rules so that they all could trust the charter actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could easily take a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special regions of development.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis, voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All the parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed on another voting age of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of 21, 21 to February, a <unk> shifting <unk> went to two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big city center that is building in Korea, is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after it went four years ago by getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second town.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow for <unk> <unk> and then would allow for <unk> to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the ultimate court for this new justice system.
There are urban planners and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go in there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go back to their family to get a job, and sometimes they are mothers who have to make money for just eating or buying clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about insist on so that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends, <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I showed you what there is here, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that is, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, literally, and more recently, photographing and publish in my blog and colorful <unk> blog and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Ah, thank you.
The <unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are passionate about, usually my money goes to a good <unk> My thing is <unk> and buying my own personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I love <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
To go back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I would find for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings somebody out of that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
<unk> inside for a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after here to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know me as the woman who walks at TED in underwear, --  that means that I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the set of sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this brilliant tiger
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you are also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you get in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to be playing the <unk> or I remember her <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost secure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person inside your interior and outside there are no way you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tested it over and over again when people were approaching me this week, just so I was using it, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home in Brooklyn, I'm going to donate the whole thing.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> colorful and bright <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic -- and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you look at a scale to measure the <unk> of each other, we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
Not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just as most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we look at the <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you can have developed over the years is that it says one thing can be only in one place at once.
That is, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing on a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it was always <unk>
But I bet the play with that parking lot has taught him a valuable lesson, which is that big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except to be a physicist of particles.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with <unk> and play with these strange particles with these little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- how they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics of a few years ago; you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the large objects around us every day.
That doesn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it also doesn't fit to my logical part.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so I shouldn't have all on the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have been.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow show that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit.
And then here we do a very good look at the small <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, a little bit of a springboard and that <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> <unk> that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in an quantum overlap but for it it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am in an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up with you to do those things, because I don't want them to tell them, or, actually, they <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey of <unk> objects are not just people, it's also the light that goes down and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we introduced a Hoover and pull it all the air, and then you put it down to a temperature of less than a degree above zero zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying still, it was <unk> and the way it was <unk> it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which is expanding and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that I didn't give at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing -- and they didn't say that at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
At the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
But it was worth caring in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the scale of a scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my kind of logical part of speech.
So imagine if you were in many places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal kept there in one piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, seemingly all of the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just holding into a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so bad.
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my boss that's here and let me take it out.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
I have a lot of negotiations and stories, with 17 very interesting museums of nine different countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story explains just on this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than I show the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we have done from his launch.
So, let's get to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
Is the gallery <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorites, to <unk> the art museum of New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on and, <unk> we're in the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the blueprint on the top, and with one click, we jump inside.
They are inside, that you want to go at the end of the room.
They go forward. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the sign <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured on what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 billion <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 billion <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get to 10 billion <unk>
You can zoom around very simple.
You see things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I went in and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and you'll see that you can actually become the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you'll actually see what it is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump back at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite <unk>
The example I showed was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this piece of <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk>
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum, to create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a zoom around.
This is about "The National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at looking at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the great question that they do today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it design sensitive.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened very interesting in <unk> racing racing over the last two decades.
So some time, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, it took a budget and they would take it to a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what in engineering, the control system is <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the real-time control systems are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming a <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population population.
75 percent of <unk> consumption and 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from a <unk> exhibition for the end of the summer during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
So in some way it is like almost all of the existing atoms become sensors and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outer environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> it says that at the end of the hammer took the hammer and he threw it back in the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> a <unk> and he said screaming, <unk> non <unk>  So what don't you do <unk>
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember -- they were playing Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, I just won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The time line is at the top.
So early there are people around here and there are doing some <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people make a call to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, <unk>
That night all went to <unk> at the center.
You see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winner and the first minister of the prime team then.
And then everybody went down.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> <unk> people are going to <unk> is a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have done just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> not about people, but things we use and we consume it.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift through the system.
We started by volunteers who helped us in Seattle little more than a year ago to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of you might have been <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening things that are complicated and there is a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> not is that it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we put on a day is still still there.
If we show it to people, then we will be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology look like to join that?
And one of the ideas that we develop at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and you have <unk> tubes that open and <unk>
It was created as a <unk> of water, with water.
If you fall down the pixels -- you can write it into them, showing patterns, images, <unk>
And by the <unk> the curtain was going to open up so that we could go, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to Mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we <unk> a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
No windows, but when you come up with it so that you can go through.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days will always have somebody in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they've been <unk> but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes away.
This is how it works.
You see people who are <unk> so it goes in.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to get the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let you go, but a building that was still making cuts and water holes, and you had to jump to get wet.
<unk> noise) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use of people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels and of water on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air, and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which moves with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen would appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then that could all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get anywhere close and you can see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light turns out, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them being controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So this is so much 3D digitization in real time as it capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can run all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
This is something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our <unk> environment like a <unk> farm like a <unk> but in a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable thing has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we move from the physical world to the digital world.
We've got everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world of the power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How do you move from the digital world to the <unk>
The idea is that we can make people engaged in doing this together, by the collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud cloud.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with <unk>
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics.
So it's a lot of physical cloud cloud as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go in there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with only a few changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for more accurate accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better form, will be stronger -- to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and safe to themselves?
How about good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that they were doing most of?
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk>
How many people would we <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative people.
That's really good.
How many choose memory?
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most people, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference but I want to give you a look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the <unk> Church -- wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if effectively accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Does it mean each other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, the more we're interested.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the period there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in most of the most basic skills of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is <unk> <unk> of which you get out of all of it.
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the youngest intestine than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think think about -- when Antonio <unk> you ask you the <unk> you think of the <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm warm -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that they can want without effort from their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of any rush <unk> to the output.
But by others, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what would we tell us?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and unique <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope they've been <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell simply divide and all the genetic energy from that cell is transmitted to two cells.
But when the organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes through sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction.
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have a confession to say that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who even <unk> in Las Vegas in their late 90 years.
And one night someone hits his hotel door to his hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a magnificent dancer.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> you look for a <unk> <unk>
"It says, George, I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different aim for the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get us healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is about changing the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level <unk> and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of us, the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily take longevity.
It doesn't necessarily translate the bigger or the stronger or the faster or even the smarter.
Evolution led to the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that they <unk> if there were fish there, fish down to the vacuum there, yet they have managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward, the <unk> phase -- I would say there are a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, in first place, we've known a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that is no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of the traditional traditional type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when the species, distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, a sexy possibility -- intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to make the individual and family level.
Think about it as well as possible to be able to choose not just sex from their <unk> but in your own body making genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reducing the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base base base pairs at a cost near 20,000 and about a week.
We don't have a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and being more and more to reach of everyone.
You get those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin on bacteria can make viruses that aren't only going to protect us but they're going to induce <unk> against other viruses.
And there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against the flu vaccine cells in a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine a good thing to go out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only other little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg <unk> and giving their children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminating diabetes, to eliminate the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same technology is <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases are going to allow us to also have <unk> <unk> better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a faster <unk> that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live time?
This is going to be so far.
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we want to make the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally would take a hundred thousand years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next hundred years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices in a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose many different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
Just for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a huge explosion when you're 3,000 meters.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to <unk>
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "No problem. Probably <unk>
And the pilot had already scratched the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
And the pilot flew the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the <unk>
Hold the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words <unk> that I heard of heard.
He said, "Go for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life was <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before you die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come in, and I didn't, all the fences I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about it later, I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to set it up.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, actually has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes -- I've tried to get better in everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives rise to my ego.
And I am sorry for the time that it doesn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought about my wife, with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, like <unk> on that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be breaking out in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love you, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I understood that the two points, the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And I was given another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge you imagine that the same thing happens to you on your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you start?
What are you going to do, they still expect to do because they think they're going to live forever.
How does your relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents to be found.
Thank you.
I've been blessed with a lot of different projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important '80s.
And one day he came home after he was running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just I want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that you saw Stephen <unk> it's not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be an important person, and you have a pretty good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Someone saw the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they go <unk> with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I engaged with his brother and his father in that very precise moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to be able to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to become his art again.
Because it is ridiculous that someone who has so much inside their inside cannot be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer that you draw on that and register negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with bad words, after the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization to move things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One is to touch the gates of the insurance companies and we get a machine to get it to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all over the world of <unk> from every corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife and I, and I moved into the back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> the frames of the walls and their place would have taken off.
But for two weeks, we were <unk> we went to the <unk> shipping walk -- my son was part, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of giant sun glasses that we bought on the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, we put it up on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds the same one, we published the software <unk> the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There is no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that I can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of science sets of all night, Tony went back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and he's looking through the support system.
We did the bed of bed that I could see.
We put a projector on a wall from the hospital.
And he went back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time that I was in seven years.
I felt like I'd been under the water, and somebody finally came to <unk> and they would take me out there so that I could make it out."
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in movement, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a red <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, the Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up with the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be at the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do possible.
None of the stuff in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the microphone, the microphone, the microphone, all was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and encouraged me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us to all do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not right now, <unk> And if I'm not me, "Why am I <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years, in situations usually very difficult and at the same time a lot dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this -- a lot of fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been dealing with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew that I would come here and do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following. I was like, <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content you might have a sense of what it is and as you put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But by saying this, it's a very good opportunity to be <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago I would not have been able to tell him for certainty.
But the new film I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been engaged in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be <unk> to something so dangerous or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to deal with products, and marketing and advertising, and that all the film would be thrown out of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to be called "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything on top at the bottom, at first, it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title -- the X.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X in the title, but we're going to make sure we all use all the categories that we can in the film.
You might be able to get a shoe -- and it becomes the great shoe that you would get.
The most great car you've driven in "The largest film, the best drink that you've ever heard of <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the marks as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> Making the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film was the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the complete idea -- all the shot shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time that I hear that -- is the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're a lot of <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk>
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meeting with them but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big marks on it.
You know, you know, you know, maybe for the moment that the film is going to look at us as a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be known.
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film or to be I?
JK: And both of them.
MS: ... means you're not really optimistic.
So, I need help. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what <unk>
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we had a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario -- it's not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle that is going to take the message to <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what it represents this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices as the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our political <unk> President <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to it actually it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency da <unk> like that weird bear that still continues to be.
It's <unk>   Like this <unk> <unk>
And it's too risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but we want to tell you about <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father sat down at some lie -- and he's looking at me as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk> story.
And you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I realized I would have to remove the proxy and go to companies myself.
So what I started to come up with all of a sudden -- that when you start to talk to companies about the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who do big movies, huge giants and others that make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who do movie movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because the brands are associated with them that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone you can say, "Are you very cool for this <unk>
You ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you that you're <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like to make a solid, <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are more good at a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that they have other <unk>
So do things like that, you know, to remind people is the reason that we're interested in.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps it cool.
How do we keep you very cool time? You get better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who are <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What are there of a common?
I need to talk to the man in the street, and people like me, <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Volunteer: <unk> My <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good one."
Woman: They revive the 1980s, it <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: Okay. What is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something just <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the type of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of colors, a lot of gray colors, many gray and things like that.
They usually take you guys like sunglasses, or the way the <unk> like the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: On a part of <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They do <unk> toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out of the <unk>
Man 5: You know, <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be an Tom mark, but I often get stuck on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world in which you are looking at as people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come out and start in a place and they start in a place and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: That's like who I'd like to be.
I like the different things.
I like weird things. I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what is that?
What is the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
You make little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience.  Big <unk> A: <unk> Thank you very much.) A: Thank you very much.)
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but it <unk> in your personality of <unk> brand, Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that a few companies are going to become one of their strong points or on the other rather than focus on both.
Many companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> prevent fear, those elements, and you actually give them a <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the Apple sound.
And you can also see <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come and come up with a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: <unk> brand <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to get your identity, you mark your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more well an <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be playful as cool as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
Or are you more of the attribute of the <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're established, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are a stable, stable, familiar, <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you use MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain as much for commercial marketing as for movies.
We went to San Francisco where they have banned advertising to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> no wall, no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting on the way in schools with children's problems.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or in which I have more successful is those who I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> <unk> took their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to be thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you have to memorize it regularly.
Well, since the film was released in <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> or press, television or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to make momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies that we talk about is giving their customers not a part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks that in those risks are opportunities.
I think that when you get out to the people that's pushing it to failure.
I think that when you train their employees at the risk of risk is preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to progress is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we go forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Today more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And he said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of the transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to name the <unk> Foundation, the <unk> Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my aid for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the world.
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- they're from a completely different technology.
But if we put a cash virus out of Windows in a laptop computer used by an engineer to set up this gray box, so we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box, <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes -- these control systems.
And that really struck us about attention, and we started an experiment where we had <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they got a very weird thing.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active in the gray box, if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is actually working on that place: <unk>
If not, <unk> does not do anything.
So that I called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled up and <unk> the attack, and we discovered that I was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally by people that obviously had all the internal information.
They get all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much they <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex, and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample from this code code.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to engage with the real world, with the real estate goals.
We need to figure out what they can pass on or <unk>
To get to the theories of goals, we remember this is definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infection has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant from <unk> and <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and asked them in an effort to bring their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate this little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that cell phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to do it slow and delicate in an obvious effort to get back crazy to test engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> on that code, you can't <unk>
I started researching scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had with my hands.
It wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would be one and same goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I really would get off.
There's the gray box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input values for example, for example of pressure sensors and sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these <unk> data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security chamber.
It's a great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only to get the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine goes off again, you have to open out of escape <unk>
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then they can spend bad things.
The plant can explode.
And the <unk> and the security system would take care of it.
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
So what I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is a <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You can also use the conventional technology of worms.
<unk> as possible.
And if you look at that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the number of targets for such <unk> attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All of the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better we start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public done in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, they really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower <unk>
There is one story, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give <unk> skills or other people that make chairs of wheelchair raise and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that you put in in the morning, gives you a big force that also increases its speed, and help you, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and other things that we have.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we start talking about the American soldier who, on average, have to take on their back a 45 pounds, load of pounds, and is being solved by getting even more equipment.
Obviously this leads to some important complications on injury in the back of the back of the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk>
So we decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or the <unk> Human Genome <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can give you 90 pounds per rough terrain for many hours.
Their flexible design, allows them to put together <unk> and run movements with great <unk>
So what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of wheelchair chairs.
There are 68 million people roughly, in lawn chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, people with damage in the spine that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is just going to be just going to be used quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or a <unk> -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who goes 19 years ago had a spinal cord injury and as a result was unable to walk for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are also batteries that give power to the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move forward with this <unk> and very natural <unk>
And I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a stranger in the air, skiing around it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and everything from <unk> down.
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never get <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last hint of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs <unk> <unk> and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of lawn chairs to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I've just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is a serious thing.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, know your cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos in the forests of Congo.
<unk> are, along with the chimpanzees, their living relatives closest lives.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we have really much too focused on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big creatures, <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been taken over decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts on the survival of the Bonobo.
Climate trade and deforestation is not going to fill in or a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, on this land of violence and chaos you can hear the hidden laughter -- hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as apes -- <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
And we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
Play increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity and diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo Bonobo sees the roots of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how they play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild <unk>
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and not a football game.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what it is doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just think in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common enough in Bonobos like humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think that as her, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos take us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future that we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But do we get the most of our ability to play?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For Bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate to play, you can be the moments where it's the most <unk>
For that, people primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and <unk> it together while <unk> creativity, gender and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, we have fires and fires as a captain of captain in a free fire system.
And in our city, where flying volunteers to a highly skilled staff has to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a fairly high chance of going.
But yet there was a race to the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our work was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were all at night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas -- while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to Captain and he asked him to walk and shake the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a <unk> to save a live to be alive just because I made it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and I bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, and I went to the fire firemen that went to the <unk> and I walked into the fire room and walked into the main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload around the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
We took out of the house of the house <unk> for the house owner where, like, you know, his trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department was a letter from the home owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness she looked at about what was other was that someone had ever had a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a voluntary fireman I witnessed the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> acts of courage and courage as well.
And you know what I learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at people who have succeeded, or are for the <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not hang on.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
They put food in a dining room, a street park in the neighborhood.
They are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody else's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> they <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of cement from a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the biggest building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, like buildings or bridges a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
He called him <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block, the favorite block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a aesthetic building world piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they're linked through magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green one, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire and the orange one.
So you just have to assemble one blue with a green one, and very quickly you can begin to make older circuits.
A blue one with a green one makes light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a <unk> which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, they're actually very powerful.
Instead of having to connect and connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using a very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slower, you just turn this button to make the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to adapt to bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a night works, or why the door of a elevator elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers with no experience in electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the School of Rhode Island School of Rhode Island who had no experience in engineering, just in wood and wood and said, Do you have something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is mostly afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became a different material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is looking for engaging with the environment focused on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
Can you take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I have a time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and the technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk>
We had a few members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World -- we send them into the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I was looking at a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody else is <unk> when he has caught up on the snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask help from this very <unk> way.
Last year in Boston, we had a team members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment we had a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that citizens <unk> with candles right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You take <unk> when you <unk>
So when you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
So it has a component uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology from the Afghan government.
And it spreads on viral form.
A responsible for systems of <unk> city to see this application realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for the citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> but people steals their batteries.
That's why the citizens who are <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just launched it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know nine cities that plan use using it.
And this has been <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
Open software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they have done for normal channels would have taken at least two and two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the power court of California that all the time over 2,000 million dollars doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every government level.
So an application that shows a couple of days to a couple of days and it spreads into viral form is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests to the government better ways to work, not like in private companies, like a lot of people think that it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
Do you feel a huge frustration before that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, a row at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that give us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they don't have any <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately comes out of us -- remember that <unk> the <unk> The way of thinking about it will affect how to produce change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, about <unk>
This is the center of public attention, and the information is.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> This phone call.
<unk> <unk> at the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music good and see if you get sick.
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a web application, and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
They don't make that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it <unk>
The <unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report, he said, "I approached the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
He went back home. I went home.
Good nights, <unk> <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to stand up and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
connected two people.
And it could be connected to the government services, but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When a neighbor help another neighbor <unk> the communities.
If we call animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry to the government system is vote.
How many times have they chosen a <unk> Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will <unk> our values and we will support our needs, but we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15 feet.
It's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> that belongs to us that we funded as something that is happening in our against, that other thing, and in consequence we are losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work out we have to make the bureaucracy to be <unk>
Because that's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that they've written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> to the government, it's time for us to ask, what world do we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to root the function of government so that it can expand leads to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act on <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old so I, to <unk> I'm a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that's grown by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to <unk> everyone will talk to you.
They can express their opinions at any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem they don't care about making your voices hear too much.
They're using hands.
They bring hands to program applications that make applications better for the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out <unk> dumping a garbage pack that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were able to have cleaned those hydrants and lots of people doing it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we are not only consumers of government that we pay and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they don't get <unk>
So I want to ask everyone else, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in everyday communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus to have given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that say here have impact around the world.
At occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we have seen fantastic.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> you can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an African-American family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery at Virginia <unk>
She was born about <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way it looked like the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, I looked at it, and I was going to give me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to me -- I was approaching me, and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I got back again and if he said yes, I stopped at peace.
I had this human quality that made you always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the less of 10.
At occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture your time and your attention.
My cousins were running around.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up in a morning, and they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it and she said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up through the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come <unk> The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell them to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now she didn't know him, I said, <unk>
And then I sat down, and he looked back, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do anything you like."
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just do I want you to tell me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to say it always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I do."
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell you, is that you will always do the right thing -- even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I'll do it."
Then, he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that you never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I do."
I grew up in the field, in the south <unk> I have a older brother and a sister a year.
When I was 14  15, a day my brother came home with a <unk> <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and to me, and we went to the forest.
We just get to the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You know, it's okay. You guys -- but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister also.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I went up with the <unk> look at the strength and say, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tell all of the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I mean it for the power that has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe that we can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My guys died of age-related diseases with alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to <unk>
Now, to try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the highest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has changed our world.
In poor communities, or black communities, you find so much <unk> so despair.
One of the three black holes between the 18 and the 30 years is in prison or parole.
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore Washington, Washington, Washington, Washington, 60 to all the young people in color are in prison or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and suspect than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger is to believe that these are not any of our problems.
We are <unk>
I think it seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some developments a good curious.
In my state in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about rights for always if you have an criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it in the next 10 years the level of loss of the loss of the loss of the loss is to be as high as before it was before it was before it was before the law of the vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence at 13 years to die in prison.
We've got this country in jail for kids, without the possibility of getting done.
We're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense of sense, they've got us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by cybercrime but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death penalty is defined by error.
Out of nine people <unk> has identified one which is innocent which is <unk> and liberated from death row.
A mistake, <unk> an innocent of every B.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never allow you ever to fly airplanes if every nine that would show you one would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history, I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, you say, <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our history of the first time with terror, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning that we have historically done.
All of the time we get together with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real process and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome race without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this compromise, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving the talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good worrying about listening to what you <unk>
<unk> we don't have death row in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room was silently and a lady said, "There is no way that we have our history, we can never get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than we are <unk> and <unk> we would put the <unk>
And so I think about this.
How do we feel it in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you actually don't care about these very difficult issues, the positive things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both things.
Now, lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means going to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never come to TED.
If you think about them it is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
We have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
We are. In spite of being <unk> so committed to intellectual property.
With innovation, with creativity. The development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection to mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also the dark and the difficult thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, guidance for spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, has to be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality by injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we're ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege as a young lawyer, to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk> lady -- we're going to get them together to speak.
Do you want to come and get it.
I was like, "Be lady. Be <unk>
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. <unk> went back to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We're trying to end the <unk> sentences of life, without freedom hanging out for children.
We try to do something about death <unk>
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and at the end I looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> was <unk> he put my finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find ways to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher to the worst thing we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong, it is not that it's a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who have to be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's how it isn't.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> we will not judge us for our technology, by our designs, not because of our intellectual capacity.
At the end of the way, the character of a society is not because they treat the rich and powerful people, but in the way they treat poor, the prisoners.
Because it is in this context as we started to understand truly deep issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
They have tired, tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I look at my <unk> and 14 years old, which have been <unk> to make them as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what isn't it?
Justice <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
I was very late at night -- I was wake up by God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should be asking for something about that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I was a 14 year-old client a tiny, <unk> black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> <unk> to be treated like a <unk> <unk> executive <unk>
In <unk> I found that there were been <unk> behavior, in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a sharp line about how in this country there is no ethical but a lack of ethics.
I woke up in the morning, thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only the <unk> had been sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally said, "Oh my God, I have to go to cut this case, stupid.
I got up to the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
And then I finally dropped out of the car.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you. I said yes.
And then I was <unk> and I was <unk>
And I was pleased with the ear, you know.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That's deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I walked into the <unk>
He saw me the judge saw me.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we started speaking.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those crazy things.
The cops came the prosecutors to <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. All infuriated because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and try to hear all that <unk>
He kept walking here and there.
Finally, this old black black black, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> <unk>
During the raise a <unk> <unk> was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black man.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up, looked at me and looked at me and he looked at me and he said, "You know, to this <unk> room to tell this young woman to maintain his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we can't really be human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> from <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Trying to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, from this community, to help in your purposes, do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities around them.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to make a effort to make the funds that spend today in policy policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of homicide cases don't have a <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't come at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to make the rule of security in safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the last three decades.
And part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The vast growth of mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war with drugs.
That's why this is this dramatic increase in the population population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people down to the <unk> chain to steal a bicycle, for small crimes, against property instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you been excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much because you come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> the threats of Bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, could be in the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that the media media would prefer <unk> news, negative news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing cares about survival, the first stop of all of those data is an old piece of the temporal lobe of the <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, the danger.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> stories of stories, looking at the negative.
That old saying about <unk> "If there's blood, you know, it's very true.
And because of all digital devices give you negative news to the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe it's not.
Maybe, instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, climate change, the water extinction and <unk> of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> problems and, in the long run, we ended up with them.
Let's take what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average per capita income per capita income has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has dropped 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kenny that global literacy passed from 25 to more than 80 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we keep getting higher expectations.
In fact, they <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put together in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law -- and doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and <unk> days in war and peace, in depression and <unk>
It's the resulting computer computers used to build faster computers.
It's not stopping any of the great challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law -- there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, and the 3D printing and the ability to democratize personalized biology, all the planet biology, synthetic biology, fuels, vaccines and digital medicine, digital medicine, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from Watson, from <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked in the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this.
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in your cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago that would be <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already been done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating life <unk> for every single <unk> to create a life of the possible.
It's about taking that <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered a silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as a <unk>
It <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about trial, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in <unk> parts of the United States, solar power will cost six cents a <unk> per hour compared to 15 cents on the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we have plenty of water.
Let's now talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after I passed on.
You know, a <unk> photo -- how do you <unk>
"A pale <unk> point.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, water, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes with nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator size.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any <unk> water, water water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just realized that I'll make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out, and I have full confidence that this will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement globally in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation, for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
And we had that <unk> warrior has better communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan took 25 years ago.
And with a smart mobile phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton was 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications and communications that nobody could have predicted that no one could have predicted it.
And so better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video, libraries of books and music, and diagnostic technology will now be <unk> and they lose value on cell phones.
Maybe the best part of it comes to you when you show up health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce to the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device with the information that they speak, and because it has <unk> can <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a whole medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are health care workers.
When this device is <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we don't want to call the <unk> of health and first of all, prevent the pandemic happening.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just had a brand of <unk> billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connecting them together.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you say? What a <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health from more health from a better education with the Khan Academy of Khan and because of the use of 3D impressions and computing computing will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What about these 3,000 million?
And if you are contributions we can't afford to.
One thing that I learned with the X X is that small equipment, guided by their passion with an idea of course, they can do things -- things that could only make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of us have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at Washington University in Seattle.
It's a game that people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college professors, college professors, and others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started <unk>
And it's been shown to be shown today that the machinery of human patterns is better <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of great challenges and doing what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary years.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> point of baseline.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you have three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that she <unk> but it wasn't that way.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
They caught it very much until the decade of <unk>
Now the fish are in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the shift of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned up with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The self was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, about mangroves.
There were <unk> of about 20 meters, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so that was more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five centimeters.
They took a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of the fishery of Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was meant to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite ugly, pretty ugly, called the <unk> four.
I went out fishing in it, and we took studies in southern China, and especially in the Southern Sea <unk>
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny blobs about <unk> remains that fish are coral reef.
In short, the sea floor came to cover and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The bottom of being a robust coral pool in this case, will be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are growing every time that they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember.
They took the point to start -- the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look, this happens something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things that are providing biodiversity, and the amount of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use <unk> images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and moved forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they didn't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze it from changes.
And at the end to keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, really, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they are no longer or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before it is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose small animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time you have a few fish, but we think that's the starting point.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that it was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence was presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you present, like Captain such and a lot of fish looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used -- or, usually they don't use the scientists in the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the enormous paper that can fulfill a protected area.
Because with marine protected areas, we really engineered the past.
<unk> the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has been running and extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their starting point.
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West, for example?
I think the arts and cinema may fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a <unk> simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you might have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why would they <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is <unk> making <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube video.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why videos are made viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today's video today makes any of us, or from our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can become famous on the Internet in a <unk>
Over 48 hours of video YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a little percentage makes it viral and get countless views and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three things: <unk> communities of participation and surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this filmed video outside his house in Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows <unk> at the popularity of last summer.
They were not saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that would take the video to the <unk>
<unk> like Jimmy <unk> are present to us with new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday Friday, you have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants to get the end of a week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: Don't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> speaking, is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
So just as we were going, <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday, in particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group of creators are taking a view of view and share it with a larger public, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this great inner joke then starts talking about that and making things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a synthetic animation with a <unk> music.
That's the way, that's it.
This year they saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
And the cats saw this video.
And there's cats you saw other cats looking at the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone did a version of the old one.
And then international became an international did.
Suddenly, emerged a whole community of remixes that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or Rebecca <unk>
What to script might have been written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video per minute, just the only unexpected thing that these things have done it.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't get too much too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you out properly through the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise of surprise and the humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we make a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of forget, creative communities of participation, totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't want permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- they're just the media characteristics -- but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had supported the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
So words, for so much time friends, <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken in history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget their story.
My task was not to let that be in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to do it, but I was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a <unk> at the dawn of <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a marriage marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to be <unk> the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
He was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> <unk> that was challenges the fiction, a boat took so slid into the sea <unk> of ship ship.
All adults knew about risks.
The greatest fear was the supplies, the rape and the death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we were first at all, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the hackers who came a number of times, but they were replaced with the bravery of men on our boat, or the driver dying and not being able to break for six hours.
But I remember the lights from the oil platform facing the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and he was going to finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I tried, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, I read in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over four generations making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of class <unk> whose population is composed of immigrants from it.
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores that came from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> were <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, then in a front line of cars, working six days to double <unk>
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and math doesn't matter what it was <unk> which was usually <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs in school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And I had <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home.
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we moved on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares were going to be able to make it out.
She opened up a computer shop and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> transition and <unk> and kids were trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in worlds parallel.
In one, it was the classical classical student with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them got help through the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year, I was picked up the young Australian year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges, not <unk>
So <unk> anonymously to <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited me to speak in places that had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about nothing.
I wanted to retire to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb called <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and this <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got up the boat.
He had never been a choice.
<unk> he said, "and you're not going to be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly the more I was talking about it -- to speak to speak.
I met people from all of the roads in life, many of them doing what they were going to live on the border of the possible.
And although I finished my work, I realized I couldn't stay in a cancer race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a <unk> a <unk> new at the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> <unk>
There was a energy there -- an unrealistic optimism mix with humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
It would take a small group of people for whom the motto cannot be <unk> was a challenge for listening.
For a year we had a dime.
At the end of each day, I did a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> even at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the United States.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised it.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he caused an award to the <unk> and bring the cause itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in Sydney <unk> when she died, 3,000 miles, in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around the <unk>
We tell them stories and we make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> their hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given who we were and how life is <unk> we can now see that the men that have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that to you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, though.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, you will lose brave in every wave, the <unk> pace of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them and see it at all.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is here in the fourth or <unk> row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians we wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
So at that time, when I went back the great prince warrior prince of course, he had <unk> pull out a bow and a <unk> on the ground, threw water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very excited.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was given this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
As a little girl my grandfather gave me her <unk> pocket pocket.
And this piece of technology was 50 years to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had a sense that the mobile phone, the luxury watches and the cameras prevent it <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I threw this technological world to see how it can use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
It took books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad -- I saw an <unk> device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where do we are.
They collect the text with the image, and animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that matter?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for iPad.
He says, "We will take your fingers on every light."
And so --  he says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character in the book.
In several times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live thanks to GPS -- that comes to me.
So my interior girl is excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons but that magic of childhood, to those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always <unk>
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And, really, they light your way in what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a child was that a whole galaxy.
So here, every book and every single world is transformed into a <unk> that I <unk> into this magical device within the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every book of fantasy there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you through the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another extremely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts in the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra over the millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child story.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been able to have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not have gone out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go out outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and, in a chapter, you get a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is a digital collection of pictures that you can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between the magic, the Earth and the technology is there many possibilities.
So in the next book, we had an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through and through using augmented reality, you see a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inner plants.
So at a moment the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to do the wind sound and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go into a world where the forces of nature are attached to technology and magic and technology come to each other.
It <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves themselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects from <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a head of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail since we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's very simple.
It has a <unk> on and <unk>
Every morning I got <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge of getting to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my data to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is, of weight, not at the same time that I need <unk> or <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers in Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some activity <unk> to have more control of their health.
From next week to be available.
This little <unk> is connected to an iPhone or the other device.
And people are going to take away from their homes, to take their blood pressure, give their physician, and share with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to recover the control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help care of health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
And we have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I want to share with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have on our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> ATMs are.
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked you, but no one would be <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves life right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> please do <unk> <unk> where, when it is open, because they sometimes open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app to <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else can use your iPhone, and the weeks of the weeks to use their cell phone cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to make them globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find and work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you go on vacation and somebody <unk> it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You might be messaging services or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please go into this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that you can't take with its cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my previous passion -- but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start with the press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road building.
But he has an unexpected turn.
And yet, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to look like it was captured in some way as photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it sound real.
They're the details or the <unk>
Let's compare light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it is about how to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but of what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here are three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think it's those in which we don't even understand the things that are around us in our daily lives.
But by combining pictures is very important, because otherwise something is going wrong.
So I would like to say there are three simple rules that are going on to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos combine to have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect loop.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the picture of a landscape, and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made the house the top of the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you need to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos the result can be quite beautiful, and it's very realistic
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide of technology, very boring.
So please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anyone who's taken from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general side.
This is a analysis we were doing about the power of microprocessors <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other people we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of output.
I'm going to talk about technology with curves <unk> it's a novel thing.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights up.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do you look at technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to show you the diagram would look like ridiculous.
That would be something like that.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look for example, some other technology, like the transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, would look like a straight line.
But if something is something like this, it gives change <unk>
If the technology of the transport technology is as fast as we last tomorrow could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development of unprecedented growth, which every few years advancing orders of magnitude.
The question that I want to make is -- look at these <unk> curves to see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible for this change as fast as it goes.
It took one of two things.
Or it's okay to turn into a typical line I know like this until something completely comes different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
And so we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we are in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, is what is that new way of <unk>
Why is new state <unk>
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember when the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is in 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
It happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that we get.
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I want to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each one billion years.
So you go back and two billion years ago when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals coming around them.
If we look at the way those chemicals organize us, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, there were <unk> oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those ice droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate the outside of the outside and so the blobs grew up with it.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms, those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a lump of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow become better as being better at an hour to bring chemical chemicals in, they grew more, and they grew more chemical and more <unk>
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a chemical form, a very simple chemistry, but things became interesting when these droplets learned the trick of the <unk>
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this particular evolution, a system of writing that allowed them to record what they were to be able to look at it.
The amazing thing is that that system of writing seems to have remained stable since it was two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the American security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If I was a <unk> he would have put it on a virus and he would have taken it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy about another billion years.
But then another big step step in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin, and they were <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are lots of resilient to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and established a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities came to both that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write the whole recipe from the board to the board of a DNA chain.
The next stage interesting for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are supportive communities of many different cell types working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscle or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and got more interesting levels that cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started to get information started.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more to process information in community.
These are neural structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those cell cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmitting information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So a organism. I could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew and became sick at the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit that ate that fruit out.
So the fact that the nervous system actually built those information structures enormously an evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea -- a very complicated idea in the head.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar similar idea -- <unk> and <unk> in their heads that holds a certain analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated and we make it sound in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started making abstractions.
We now go through periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer computing, the <unk> <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen at microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we have accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history that I told you about led to a billion years each.
The next few times the nervous system and the brain took a few hundred million years.
The next few language, they took less than a million years.
And next one, like the electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something to accelerated its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent artistic advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine, and the machine does something that you can do before you can't even can, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please take a long computer, you can run a hundred million views.
You could just run these sequences, at random, running all those programs, and take those that more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to tell you numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are more <unk> to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, "You could take 10 percent of those random sequences that they had better did the <unk>
It <unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now you get the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a <unk> process to <unk>
So let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that the kids will sing the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of product programs that had a little bit more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
I had some mutations <unk>
And it tries to new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are going to be absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to get it to see how they work.
They are brown programs, strangers.
But they meet <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of that goal because they come from a lineage from hundreds of thousands of programs that do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
Once I went on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're becoming complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use these programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
Or is it <unk>
The thing goes faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what comes in.
But now it comes lunch and I think stop here before I get back.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for letting me give up a part of my false <unk>
Before I tried to deal with my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Wide World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of getting <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope many of you know it.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about 300 percent of a <unk> that we see 300.
That means that the <unk> bat was going to be three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to throw it down to the first base, not reaching time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk> <unk>
By the way, that's someone that from 10 bucks, they get four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season in a regular season.
Now I get this to my medical world where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are subjected to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place, and a dear being has two clogged arteries and his family doctor derived a cardiologist whose family record is derived from 200 percent.
But do you know something?
She's getting better this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think it must be the average of hits a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, for a doctor or a <unk>
So what we do, however, is send them to the world, and I would stand up with the mandate to be perfect.
I never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the take-home message when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied until a blood test.
Just like that.
I put in my little <unk> at the nurses of the General General in Toronto, not from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> <unk> about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And I read from medical school with the impression that if you were all -- then it would know everything, or as possible as possible, close to everything, because so I was telling you about mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident at a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the emergency lady in the emergency room where I worked.
I was assigned to <unk>
And when the emergency room requested that to a cardiologist I played that patient.
I report to the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which sent me heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump your blood forward, blood goes to lungs, and these are <unk> and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was <unk>
I gave <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on your heart.
And I gave him <unk> of water, so that I could eliminate a liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't put up the phone, and I didn't do what I should have done, I would call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to bring up the data.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident for constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> I could take care of my patients without even calling my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
As I sent her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner mind that was like, <unk> is not a good idea. We don't know.
In fact, I was so confident that until I asked the nurse who was taking care of Mrs. <unk> "Do you believe that he's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought of and then he said <unk> "Yeah, I think it's going to be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the tall, and the ambulance next to the ambulance and the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in our stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I went through the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was in order to go home. I did something I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I don't do normally, at the time.
I went through the emergency emergency service service.
And there another nurse, not that I was talking about Mrs. <unk> before, but another one was telling me three words, those three words that most emergency medical <unk>
Another specialists who are afraid that they are afraid of as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see patients in <unk>
The three words is: Do you remember you?
"It remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and the edge of death.
After an hour of having arrived at his house, after I gave him the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance <unk> they brought them to the emergency room with a blood pressure from 50 millimeter from <unk> which means a severe severe shock of it.
I barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff would take all their resources.
They gave up medication to go up with blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and expected against all hope that he would get.
And in the two or three days it was obvious that we never came.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they went to what was happening.
And to the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks after, I got confused by it and experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and sat down alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame, because you can't touch with your colleagues.
You make peace and you will never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was it wrong, we are bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I am sure that I would take the stuff out and made sure that I didn't give up.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why was he sent home?
And in my worst questions: Why made I made an error so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little at that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day, he opened up the sky and eventually came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if you were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not making more errors, would make your voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was an assistant, in the emergency department in a community hospital north in Toronto, and I got a man in 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he was standing here.
I watched his throat, he was a little <unk>
He had taken him penicillin and he sent him home.
But as he ran to the door still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> shift, my boss asked to speak with me in his office.
And he gave the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw in the <unk>
And he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can put it on Google. It's an infection, not because it's an infection, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, luckily, not <unk>
It was <unk> antibiotics through <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and over again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a lot of effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't go home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
<unk> an kidneys of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague that was checking the patient would be some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He order the liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to make it out.
And I checked it out and when you see some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get married and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what's really going on, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after a failure, to failure?
Of course at a party you're going to hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you're not going to hear somebody talk about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> my wrong leg, believe that I would have a time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> which are making mistakes and the ones that <unk> the ones that don't sleep and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction like antibodies that begin to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you move from medicine to people who make mistakes, you will become a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of course about <unk> and medical journalism I've done a personal health study and medical journalism and doctors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto "Star to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every single day, where one in 10 drugs are going to be wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where bacterial infection is increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 100,000 Canadian per mistakes <unk>
The U.S. Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it is about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there's things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
The dream sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in his chest, comes to <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath of a sudden, my story <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars, they didn't raise their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we took the system like we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals prone to error, well, it's not going to be no one.
And with it that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, it's already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the world's <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> -- this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And his students were <unk> <unk> <unk> head and <unk> and they started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, I don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a whole medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical physician is a human, you human, they accept it and not be proud of their mistakes, but it is trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They took their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people don't intend to <unk> but in a loving way and the support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings will run the system, and when this happens, you make mistakes of time in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> errors <unk>
And I feel a lot, but I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what to think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently I made a survey of over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that he says to pick an American American are about 70 to a day.
It didn't do a long time ago in a research to a group of presidents of mine.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks by these executives and the time that we would have to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Now some of the work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of its time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the <unk> category and how many of the <unk>
How do you focus the way that they manage those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the wind overload of the options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as I am blind, I want you just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive <unk> please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to hear the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford, <unk> this supermarket at a very, very fancy level at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and 25 water <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why would I never buy nothing?
This is a shelf of oil <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> coming from trees <unk>
I once decided to go to the manager of a manager and I asked him, "Do you work well this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed down to me with tourists full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to make a little experiment. This is the <unk>
hall.
They had a different classes.
<unk> a post for <unk> right to the entrance store.
We put out there -- six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
So here we found the opposite effect.
When I had stopped when there was only three percent it got to buy <unk>
When there were six, when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably have a lot less good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to do not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the topic of the day, the saving of financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at the savings decisions for retirement for about a million Americans, from a million Americans, from the country plans.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of money offers available savings plans for retirement, <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had plans that went from two to 59 different options.
We found that the greater the number of fund funds had less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that offered a few <unk> the rate of participation came to the 50th 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for the people who decided to participate, the older it was the number of choice, more people were getting to avoid actions or investment.
As long as there were more options, they were more willing to invest in financial health accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to, to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative consequences of providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they <unk> the decision, that <unk> even when this is going against their self-interest.
You are more likely to take the worst responders, the <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less than <unk> even though you're likely to get it better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that massive array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparing that to contrast and choose from that amazing <unk>
Today I want to tell you four simple techniques that we have in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in your business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But what we're seeing is what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of <unk> <unk> there will be an increase at sales -- <unk> costs -- will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, watched 10 percent rise of 10 in sales.
When the corporation Golden <unk> eliminated the products for eating cats that would less <unk> they were increased by <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and lower costs.
You know that even today, on average today, they offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store there is about 100,000 products.
But the biggest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the global savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come up with how to handle the choices is by David <unk> the Harvard program.
Every Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a fund of safe life.
The people who really want to choose, are they offered 20 <unk> not 300 or more.
They know often that people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk> either.
This evening, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a holiday to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want they to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
Are you not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really hit getting more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first turn, than in the second turn, but I can tell you and say they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of the choice of choice is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each other, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why are people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit or credit when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that it looks more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting is exactly as <unk> we made a little bit of <unk>
What we added was that we paid the personal to the staff who would think about the positive things that would take in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts at <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine classroom.
We saw that in supermarket <unk> along the <unk> corridor, the display of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds to <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This rating framework is completely useless.
<unk> must tell something to you who are not going to be <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge lists of funding.
What are I supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just have a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision -- a purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allow it to <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color in the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is cause the order to make the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from a lot of choice, 56 colors, a few boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few choice, four muscles to 56 colors, so many options.
And what about <unk>
How involved you are.
If you get <unk> the default button in each decision, this indicates you're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to few days -- to get the default button over and again and another one.
They <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order in which the information is.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we choose the box of changes don't say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To wrap up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> overload of the computer overload we can eliminate alternate alternatives -- we can do it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for the people to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful to <unk>
And the more you're going to be in our choices to be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the East East Germany, I mean, if you had a typewriter that was supposed to write to the government.
I had to register a sheet of text that was written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they were in the writing of the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much that we would do -- the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow print on every page that you follow a pattern of one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can put up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are they <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> City, in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many people who are online online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal means by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service of the United States, two months ago, I noticed this guy, Sam <unk> and this has <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> hangs <unk> they don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely that any of us are a victim of a <unk> which is a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be <unk>
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, and they motivate them the protests, they motivate them questions laughter.
Anonymous is <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national states, the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an <unk> authority authority from the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the collapse last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and saved a <unk>
Last week I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government meeting, he asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a attack from these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do they serve <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except it <unk> a foreign <unk> authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it was exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters -- the headquarters of the secret secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a large scale of the citizens of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used German officials to research their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a <unk> case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it's more there.
It will spread the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen online and listen online to get our data.
When we think closely about things like these the obvious response should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to be <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy versus safety.
It's about the freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right, any right that we spend today, being forever.
They were blindly <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have been worried about in the next 50 years.
Here's where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no length of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our won.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it, I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and that's why we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying of the warriors protect our community and won, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of their father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid.
But I realized that this didn't really happen, because he even helped the lions see the pen away.
Don't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to trick lions for they believed that they were near the <unk>
But male lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, "This thing is not moving, it's always here.  So jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a light switch on and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk>
They get everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery -- the electricity to the small <unk> <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights down.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And this is how you look at lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never went to have trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it at seven houses in my community, and they are serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, to frightening to other predators like seawater. <unk> and it's also using elephants from farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship into one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds.
And I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid on the <unk> of the savanna the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes to be able to fly, and he told me that one day would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to become an engineer and a pilot and a pilot when they <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without a conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on the other electric inventions here.
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a close electric fence -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that the <unk> <unk> but I want to make mine.
CA: You know, I would just take it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: The foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to put it on every step that you can get my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is enemies.
But sometimes I was asked about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed in North Korea.
When I was seven years, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor, and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague of my sister.
That was saying, "When we were <unk> the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks of past.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At some time, when I walked across the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete my memory.
One woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine took to North Korea to <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and just few survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> and all of me around it was completely dark, except for sea lights in China, barely across the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to go across <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I see bodies floating in the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how I went out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I was sent to China to live with loving relatives
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like to be like an <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because refugees North Africa were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible <unk> in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became the fact that I was arrested when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Someone had accused me for being <unk> then I would take my skills in the Chinese language and asked a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to finish up.
But I got to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told each other, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum.
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
And even after learning a new language and finding work, everybody can take it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to put a room to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or a <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call my pride with pride and proud of me.
Although I went to life in South Korea it was not easy, and I made a plan. I started studying for the university.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent to my family, and as blame, my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location of the way to the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and North South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and moved to the border with North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to sort of <unk> for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the <unk> and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came to my family, <unk> I stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We made all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border of <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I made everything for free to free my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison to <unk> away from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and to get them to take them out of prison.
I read with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I tell me?"
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, a new hope for me and for the village to choose when they were <unk>
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community is really the hope of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, and we sat in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language, labor practices and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us follow in touch with family family inside, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is <unk> <unk> grocery stores, fast food, <unk> terrain.
So the city planners got together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something more, so they changed to Los Angeles <unk> as if this is going to be what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a desert of food, Los Angeles City Center, home to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that places of food to bring more people in the car.
People are dying of diseases in the Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times more than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I emphasize seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the <unk> effects, the current food system has in its <unk>
I see chairs <unk> and sold as self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet away from me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided to go.
So my group and I L.A. Green <unk> we put us together and start planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine bright vegetables.
So what we do, we are a kind of paid paid group to go ahead of all the <unk> of all the <unk> all over the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then somebody gets <unk>
The city stood up to me and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A <unk> court order to plant food on a piece of land than nobody else <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time was not going to happen.
L.A. Times had a story written by Steve <unk> and he talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition on <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> I even called to say that I was <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
So L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk> ground.
It has 68 miles of terrain.
That's equivalent to 20 Central <unk>
That's a space to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why does the hell look like this?
Let's make a plant give a few thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars to give you 75 dollars.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality, which was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such an artist of <unk> who are <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It was <unk> to see what the Earth can do, if they let them be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a education tool, in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
And you get rid of seeing how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came up with a mother and his daughter, and they were like the <unk> at night and were in my own garden, and looked at a lot of <unk>
I, I felt wrong that you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes me that people go to steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh my God -- I'm not afraid you're going to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how it had affected them and how they used to plant with their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed them, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of them in plan voluntary.
If kids grow up, they will eat <unk>
If you grow the tomatoes, they will eat <unk>  But if nothing of this is told, if you don't teach them how the food affects your mind and the body, they eat blind what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're stuck. I see color kids that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take a container and turn them into <unk>
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people together to work on the street, bring kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Would you take your <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, you know, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs, and having meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with their <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very good road at all.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains very much.
They can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you're standing on your bike and these cars go out, that's not very nice.
Also, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we built roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has <unk> and water can go through it, so all the rain water will flow into the sides and you will have a road because it's easy to drive, and you don't get the water out of the world.
Noise is also gone.
Because it's very hollow, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road a <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road the stones and <unk>
First one stone, then several more and more and more, etc., and then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But they can hurt her <unk> and you're not going happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see what damage damage into this material.
It's a asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if you were <unk> they'll be <unk> and they got out of the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you will take the <unk> you see it here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material together, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> steel wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the <unk> of steel into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we got asphalt with little bits of <unk> steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can rise, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you need to do is actually heat the steel and melt the <unk> the <unk> flow of these <unk> and the rocks are attached to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave furnace is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We need to <unk>
So donated a piece of road, 400 feet of the highway <unk> where we had to do a <unk> lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then of course, this road is going to last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made an aging age, we put a lot of charges in them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, in closing, I can say that we've made a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, and they can even double the life of the surface of the road, they actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity of whether this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
And you have to really cool it first before I can show you how it acts on it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My dad was listening to News in his little gray radius.
I had a big smile on his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban got my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was given as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could both have them.
Every day, we take a different route that nobody could be suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books on market bags so it looks like we were shopping.
The school was at a house, over 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, the school had suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you were going.
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province. of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother went out to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my polite mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It was made two years ago, just to turn our home into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his entire family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, even despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate his children.
For the years of <unk> I remember that there was times when I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can get your house home during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want not to <unk>
Today, I have 22 years.
I grew up in a country which has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age have more than <unk> and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate from <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home by the courage of educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who has been driving over the streets of Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, and a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the great desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families that, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite them and even in the face of an opposition opposition.
As <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally they escaped to be killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you got home, you're the phone, a voice noticed that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would get it to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but we didn't harm the future of my daughter for her old and your old ideas."
What I've given to me is, in Afghanistan, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need support for men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I'm afraid that these changes were not last long enough after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look back to the students in my school and their parents who are afraid of them, I see the <unk> I see a <unk> future and <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution broke out, inspired by the <unk> <unk> <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution, like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens built inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> they were in the <unk> <unk> the decline of the regime, they were carrying their freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a connection to the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the south, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of a brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, culture and moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved -- along with many other women, rebuild civil society -- <unk> a inclusive transition and fair to democracy and national reconciliation.
There are about 200 organizations in <unk> for and immediately after the <unk> roughly 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years from exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women who were <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very skilled autonomy from women and for our right to participate in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was <unk> from selfish politics of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, soon to little, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day, we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another <unk> with the murder of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day, we woke up with the news of murder officers in the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and the violation of human rights in the prisoners and the lack of respect of law.
Our society, made out for a <unk> mindset -- more and away from the ideals and the beginning of freedom, dignity, justice, which we were at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all for us today with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
Right now, I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we choose to make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society on <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination, and <unk> as much for men as for women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the choices, that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the dominant representation of the female to need the most important representation of representation and quantitative of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also to put it to practice mercy instead of <unk> collaboration rather than <unk> <unk> rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately needs to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> which spans the whole humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns have <unk>
And so just like the uterus, it covers completely the <unk> that grows inside the <unk> matrix of compassion all the existence.
So this is what you say, "My mercy is <unk>
This is how we say, "My mercy happens on my <unk>
They have to tell them the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
So I'm here today to talk to you about a logical question that has an equally <unk> answer.
Is it about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everyone makes you <unk> Why is it left?
Why would anyone be going to stay with a man who told him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, and not a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had just taken away at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, I thought I was creating my alma mater, I would join my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where they fall in every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> of the Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies for the list of <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington D.C.
I'm almost 20 years married to my second husband and have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all of the religions, every single levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> and long duration or, in the families, the last place where they would want to or expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who would stick with a man who would stick with it, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence from domestic violence than the other ages, and over half of the other ages, and girls from that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had also had a college of a university from the <unk> <unk> and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was most impressed by that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it especially at the beginning in a <unk>
We started getting out and loved everything of me, which was so list, I'd gone to Harvard, that he would be passionate about helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was because of that <unk> and the job on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much so much for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I'm going to go from New York and leaving the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do some sacrifices for your partner, so let me quit my work and <unk> and I went up with Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was entering a physical <unk> financial <unk> and carefully psychological trap.
The next step in domestic violence is to introduce the threat to violence to see how it reacts with it.
And this is where you go in the scene of the scene.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site is supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so sure he bought three guns.
One was in the <unk>
Another one is kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns from the trauma that she lived in a small basis.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted up my hand, my life was already serious for every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> was five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises out of my neck had <unk> I put my mother's suit, and I married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that I was living happily forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me to have a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
They were just very <unk> by the wedding and in the fact of a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I would never get any harm.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in my head that I would spend various times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey and <unk> by traffic and threw myself a Big Mac cold to the face.
He kept on <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of the three American women is a victim of domestic violence violence at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a very strong man -- and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> face their <unk>
The other question all the world does is: Why don't it just be <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the most sad and painful question that people do, because we have our victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of domestic violence in domestic violence happen after the victim has finally given to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has no longer to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to it -- <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who normally are forced by the judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's just not going?
I was able to <unk> because of a last <unk> beat up my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed it if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody to the world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, to full unknown, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the trend to <unk> victims as headlines as <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say "The fault is by <unk> as if the victims are committed to men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned that they learned a lesson lesson from what happened to them, and they would promote their lives joyful and happy lives of <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I became marrying a tender man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do is to have never more, ever is a gun that is <unk> to my head in the hands of someone who says it wants to me.
At this moment, they are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were <unk> they are <unk>
The abuse could be affecting his daughter, her sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy particular love, the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Metaphor thrives just in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence just shedding light over it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They put the abuse of light talking about it with their children, their friends of work, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as amazing people and <unk> that have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervening consciously, to slow their climb into their climb and show the victims to a safe safety.
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis of safe and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress up like that.        luckily, I've brought my clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to <unk> now, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These aren't very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to spend this sweater through your head, because it's when you're going to laugh with me, so you don't do anything while I'm covering my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but we also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that he would raise her back and put the hair off the kid.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made a couple of days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our behavior, which, as shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model, I am on this point.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, and that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how does it get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made my model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an heritage, and maybe you're asking what this heritage.
Well, in the last centuries we have not just defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed for <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage heritage, that I have known to take money to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now show up, and maybe there's some <unk> in fashion that <unk> <unk> there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing about models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told all and each of the models in the <unk> and of the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- is that less than four percent, were not white people.
The next question that people always make me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I'm not dealing with that.
But after, what I really would tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, as you are the first.
If you go on this spectacular <unk> but no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model to say that you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have heard of your studies, and you have a <unk> and you have a <unk> and a lot of jobs to your back, no matter what you would want to be president of the United States, but your copy sequences of underwear for 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was going to, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
This is how my grandmother was in a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
So here I am with my football team and in the presidential magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always make me is: Are you doing things for free?
I have too many inches from 20 inches and never use, except the couple of that, but the privilege that I get are the ones I get in the real life, and the ones that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and I was given the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> went into a red light and of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent <unk> to be able to keep going.
<unk> of these privilege by my way, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price of how they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who were killed by 86 and 86 percent of them were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them, is not a matter of <unk>
It's about how many times <unk> and <unk>
When I research this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure takes up at 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people do is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little thinner and you have a little thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe this is so <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and it's also amazing to work with creative and creative people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the brighter hair will be happier.
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs -- the brightest hair and our clothes -- but probably the most insecure women of the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image of the image of the success and the failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was enough to hold into a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more <unk> photos and I didn't get my <unk>
There was no <unk> or no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a little bit of care in the lighting.
In fact, most of you took a random tourists at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and the 5.
He took the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can now imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife came to me, why don't you take you to <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
Here is when we start to ask the tourists that we would have to get out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unfamiliar is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has never touched the camera.
And so we weren't aware of how much it would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what happened that day as that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are a lot more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we take the same picture, our perspective change, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the trips, we were walking, when suddenly he stopped on the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the wooden store, which would show you from small on earlier visits on before.
And he described to me what I felt at five years of foot in that same place.
He remembered that reminded of their heart and force when they saw that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he's looking at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things that we created is memories.
So, I want to share the idea of being actively engaging in conscious creating memories.
I don't know you, but aside from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes a picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you don't want to go close to someone and ask me, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most famous <unk> group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, and he said, dumb silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't retain the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World World.
So why are they <unk> they're important, but first of all, provide vital ecological services.
They are our <unk>
They <unk> the carcasses to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that it wasn't because they would stretch and cause large loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge branching into the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge important importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lobby and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between Emma and below Egypt.
In the mythology -- <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian devil in 10 shrunken heads.
In <unk> culture, they make a lot of important <unk> to open sky, in places like Tibet -- there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which is six of them at the end end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there's conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years -- and the reason is because they fall prey to livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned in India and have taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs on the number of <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time for <unk> The number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> to serve <unk> and to the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a locally locally and it's not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become active to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you what we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures <unk> their time to spread the word <unk> the word.
When you walk out of this room, they will report to you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed because he saw it by flying without effort, and without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young man, but I was not supposed --  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the <unk> that Italians were Italians -- we were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything else we would expect.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people of Zambia to growing food.
So we reach out with <unk> <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach the local or growing tomatoes and <unk> and and ...
And of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so that they were interested in to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were amazed that local people, in so fertile valley, didn't have had agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking them how it was possible that we didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> time to save the people in Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato spot to make this size in Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe that we were telling the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared in the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> my God, <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you know it? "You're never <unk>
I thought only that the Italians were looking at errors in Africa, but then, I saw what American Americans, did what they did the English is, and then they were looking at what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you see, at least we feed the <unk>
We would see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that they gave them to <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It's part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are an <unk> missionaries missionaries and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any different culture as if I was my sons, "I want you very much a lot.
<unk> I try to get all of the different culture in a culture, like my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face. Little little <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can just imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to have 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything with anybody, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does you do? It <unk>
It will never get a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee. We sat down at a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you?
The passion that she has to its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for one time, they would tell them, but not at meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never be told in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have a <unk>
So, planning has this kind of point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face face-to-face you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
You should create a new career.
The profession is the family physician of the company, the family family of the business, the business family of the business, who has you at home on your kitchen table, and that helps him find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this <unk> garbage that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see me to see how you can do that?
How can I do it?" I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
I was <unk> and so --   So --  So --   So the government says, <unk> again.  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to conversation with you.
privacy, you have to offer it for privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then you will be able to go in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What is you going to show you more <unk>
<unk> local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the spirit spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution that is <unk> not renewables, and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine isn't sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> it's not sustainable.
So what we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- how we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who's going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a remarkable story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York in the year <unk>
And in the year we had gathered this group of people, and they <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that was <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States -- <unk> manufacturers manufacturers <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few days -- <unk> factories in places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give them <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then you have to give them an absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then you have to get to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and search for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not not born.
We looked at and looked at the 100 icon of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small <unk> environment -- in coffee bars in <unk> alongside their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who talks about this <unk> someone who asked you, what would they need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those are around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't buy a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and understanding our <unk>
How do you share more of our hopes for cows stores so our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries -- and I trust a city.
It always gives music to music.  There's a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most abandoned U.S. properties.
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood, and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and <unk>
I thought a lot about death and then.
And this made me a deep gratitude for life and long time.
It gave clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let's try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be left by the day and forgetting the really important thing for you.
So with old friends and new friends transformed the wall of this giant house on a giant slate and painted about it sentences to <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
I used to die by <unk>  Before I died I want to sit on the line of <unk>
I used to die for millions of people."
Before they die I want to plant a <unk>
I used to die outside the <unk>
I want to tell you once more."
Before they die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
"Before they die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me laughing <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It is about knowing that you're not alone. It is about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection and <unk> and of remembering what the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues at the civic center we did a kit and now have been done in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we showed the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it is more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is a short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that being prepared for death is one of those things that would become more power.
When you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
Don't speak, but it transmits joy from some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
It's sharing it <unk> what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and notice about this: Never <unk>
When he singing songs from our childhood, trying to say words that I could not even be <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
We had the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year he came out each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, you would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like amazing?
But most people agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> they are often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though we wouldn't consider it within the <unk> that could only mean one thing: they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself differently, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, are diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the disorders of development that faster in the world, there is no cause or known <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
They got a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting car in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that there would be.
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> frustration and the endless hyperactivity had something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature -- a child who looked at the world <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> goes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could give it a single thing to <unk> and Sam and of you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> -- they're a <unk> each one of us has a gift in your inner and, honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and the change dies at the moment we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what was going to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State State University was asked to me, a research teacher to give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their big unknown words.
But when those conversations develop those conversations, I felt what they would have must have felt when he fell down the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
So I sat down when I had those conversations with the students. I was surprised that the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges and care of health care, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please go through <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that we can see that their science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that they study <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as <unk>
Instead, as Einstein said, Einstein, which is everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- these are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I introduce your job, forget about signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do they do <unk> <unk> and <unk> their presentation.
One <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supported by too much in the area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then give you graphs that will adapt to our other senses and create a sense of deeper sense of understanding what they get.
I think these are just some key ones that can help each other open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire Oxford Oxford Oxford <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an Austrian editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looking for a public charge no matter or a very beginning, and that, when she wins, he gets him for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
Something about words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to be the exact words that were said in the camera <unk>
And this was all because of the bravery of a guy with the unlikely name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They put him at the Tower of London and he <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end of it had such a popular support in London that won.
And only a few years later, we had the first record of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's because of a freedom of freedom of freedom of course.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back in America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented to all kinds of suggestions that they might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tried to be tested quality.
And not even with it they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen by the King of a given time.
And there might be <unk>
All the world got tired of them, <unk> because this debate was going to be spent for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to fall out of power.
They didn't want to call it King if he was giving him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> and more <unk> <unk> they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title before, but it only meant <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were African-American presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a <unk>
And that's why the Senate was <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would you take in serious with a <unk> and <unk> title as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate did not survive.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate between the action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measurement is <unk>  <unk> possible that we are going to keep waiting for me for years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and this is the most important thing -- is that America's President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 warheads warheads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has survived the title of <unk>
So I actually won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, as well as <unk> well, it was an <unk> then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 heads of nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to be feeling humble when they tell you that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but really, really changes a lot more the words than these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters underground in a interested in Ghana.
The air is uploaded to heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak -- but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with primitive tools.
As others, I carry a cheap flashlight of light, and he holds the head of this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole of a meter that drops hundreds of feet on Earth.
It was <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a little bit earlier, who lost control and she dropped countless feet in that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at that hole at the risk of their lives without a reward and often they dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they might never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 continents in six continents in 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the state of <unk>
Among all of the amazing people I met there was a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been engaged in the modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not about about grade.
When you end up talking really sad, I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a stomach <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
It started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even, I considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty dirty guys.
A conservative calculation says that there are now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of African Africans throughout the whole slave is <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about <unk>
But today, you can tap into entire families for generations of <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates returns over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promise of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, under threat to violence and cannot escape.
Today, slavery operates at <unk> the goods produced by slaves -- but those who produce them are disposable people.
The slavery exists around the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, in fact, entire families -- in fact, <unk> in a heavy cloak set in their head, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and tiredness work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, no enough to drink, and the severe <unk> did that to pee out very <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I was not citizenship that country.
I could put them in a much worse situation that they were already had.
I had to trust the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and he trusted the way it would be.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids dragging children for miles per miles per <unk> land to trucks that were waiting down.
Those great <unk> were heavy than the kids that carried the load and the kids would send them to their heads with straps and made out of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of the global awareness that I would have been difficult to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I had women who had been previously <unk> sex.
It led me through a few steps that would give this <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as they know in the craft, they are local for prostitution <unk>
They have small rooms, private rooms, where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of these only seven years -- they're forced to hug clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a painted number on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their <unk>
On the <unk> I remember having a sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I barely could imagine what it must be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> on the stairs where it was <unk>
There were no <unk>
There were no windows enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because they touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in <unk> in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex slave year.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often with the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families <unk> in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
Your black hands are from the father, and the <unk> of blue and the red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid until <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, be able to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two brothers, a few older kids, some more young kids, and it makes sense.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families and forced to work on these boats on the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
So the branches of the trees submerged in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, they become the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it comes to the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at the age of five in the morning, when they woke up the last networks, but they had been working from one another.
<unk> and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a shelter in which the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because of someone decided to make a difference in their life?
He went through a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his husband suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
It asked us to do it on a road of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out very quickly.
And then pointed out this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the way. <unk>
As we started down, we took off the <unk> that I would put on the road and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was filled by the recent <unk> so I put my photographs of pictures on my head as they were going to be able to get in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the road ended up <unk> in one of the way, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all full of migrant workers.
A lot of women had children strapped on their backs, and, while they were looking for gold, <unk> in waters <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they were out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people carry together heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area where they <unk> the stone to get the gold out.
First of all, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer, on the edge of the margin -- we see to work on some less fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> end up like this <unk> victim and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying their uncle, <unk> inherit the debt of the uncle that force it to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked on the mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in <unk> so severe that doctors say it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet to that, he's forced to work on night and day in that mine.
And yet, he has been released with being released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote ability that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give <unk> to them and that we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazine -- real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect for their lives.
There is no day that I think I don't think about these beautiful beautiful people, I've had the great honor to know.
And I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see them, in people like you, and I hope that the force turns out a fire and that fire <unk> light over slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied mathematical mathematics, and there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> we are like <unk>
Nobody knows what the heck we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the more human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later.
But the ballet demands an extraordinary training level a high level of dexterity -- a high level of skill, and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time was a virtuous dancer dance.
In the last few years has been made a lot of progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> weakness <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way that we know if there is actually a cure when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement that have no biological <unk> That's why they don't have any human analysis and the best thing we have is a <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials -- never done.
And what if patients could do it home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do it with ourselves?
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to describe to you as a kind of not conventional <unk> you can see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vocal <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds like talk, we can imagine how a dancers of a vocal ballet <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that are needed for example.
And as they did it, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From sound, we can trace the position of the vocal cords as it <unk> and so the Parkinson's will affect the <unk> also affecting the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of irregular <unk> of the vocal strings, <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams, based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test, isn't <unk> both of the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole host of hospitals to do them.
Both are <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're very minimal and we all know what happens to happen.
When something becomes so <unk> it appears to mass scale.
These are some amazing lists for <unk>
We can reduce our patients.
I wouldn't do to go to the clinic for a pregnancy <unk>
Ultimately, we might be able to make data goals.
We could make massive recruitment for low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or <unk> can call under price and leaving recordings for about cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.    Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say, who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> You may not have it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion look for the real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a accuracy <unk> at this point?
A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I've got to have a fantastic work and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone network too, what we will <unk> the project. We now have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are creatures, gray.
We were <unk> in the dark, in no windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do that thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin we do -- we can even be able to do the impossible possible -- we can do it in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going to be in Japan.
Now, shortly after that, an organization where it was <unk> there was <unk> -- there was the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we were not going to be sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May <unk> I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing town located in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave <unk>
The level of water has reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We take rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. And we took the <unk> houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We love it and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found the similar things.
They found pictures and photographs of pictures and cameras and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of villages around us.
It wasn't until so I realized that those photos represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As I went out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a center of <unk> people.
It helped clean the stall, <unk> huge <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day was going to be taken in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard of expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until far beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some of you who were over a hundred years old in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted some of them, and in the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to do a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they got more lucky, and they needed more <unk> so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 people volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people who were getting <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village neighbor to Northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the temporary business libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
So the time that we have in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could make a time for an hour. It could be a weeks.
It could make a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using a guide of the areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these <unk> photos in salt water, covered with bacteria, with seaweed, even oil -- all of them along with the time I continue to go through it, so I <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't take the picture unless I was clean dry and he would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky enough with <unk>
We have a <unk> of an <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos already <unk>
As I once said, <unk> the leader of my group is like doing a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same but he stopped at the realization that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face would not have <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and cut the whole picture.
When I picked up their photos shared something of his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the photos at a fire station between the rubble that were far away from where they used to be their house, but their colleagues would tell you.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their young kids, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find his whole family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave his photos his younger son <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do -- something that he could remember from the past that would never have been marked by that day from March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, <unk> hundreds of they helped us to clean up over <unk> photographs -- the vast majority -- the vast majority -- the vast majority -- the vast majority of their individual <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families and hundreds of photos totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend 1,000 dollars in teams and equipment -- most ink <unk>
We took all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a person, somebody loved one.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would expect, but the first thing we would take to look for.
This was about this project, to restore little pieces of humanity, from bringing someone back to the past.
When a picture is sent to somebody, a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger -- and I put something, using your talent for something that aren't thin models of perfect skin.
To finish up I'd like to read this email I was sent to Cindy the day I came from Japan after six months.
And as I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from grandmother to the small girl, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me -- because a similar picture of my family, my grandmother, and my <unk> <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are themselves, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder, and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition in a single <unk>
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a billion frames per second.
I introduce you to a new kind of <unk> a new technique that can create video on slow motion of light motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-rays, X-ray really <unk>
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it on and put it on a <unk> of a second, or you know, in a number of <unk> create a <unk> pack of just one millimeter wide here.
And that set of photons, that <unk> traveling to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a single bullet does.
If you take that bullet and this pack of photons and shoot in this bottle, how do you remove those photons in this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember, all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes it to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a pack of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
And part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of them finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounce inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the thoughts of the top you see it at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow motion, to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film --  -- a bullet is going to move into motion.
And how about <unk> nature <unk>
You can see the waves that fall off the table, the tomato wall and the wall of the bottom.
Is it like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a <unk> composition of it.
But if you look at more and more of this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light gets thrown from the tomato <unk> it goes <unk>
Why? Because the tomato line is <unk> and the light bounces inside its inside and comes back after several <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at <unk>
As a photographers, you know, if you take a picture of low light enters a little bit of light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than you can just get into some light.
It <unk> that <unk> that set of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and interesting data in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see it after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
The left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities alone.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it corresponds to how distance.
So when you project a laser can record a picture in gross, which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we are going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we look at it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> so that they are around the curve, so on.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But, of course, because tissue and blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new <unk> of <unk> to solve the problems of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became the science in art, art of photography.
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every time is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
So creating a new form of computational photography with slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk>
But here's a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move into us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order that the events occur in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, you will go to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people have been looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people who are going to be <unk> you know, looking for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who can show you a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot of all of you today have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how it changed to me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European company, every single single Internet vendor in Europe, has to store a wide range of user data.
Who calls <unk> who sends a email to <unk>
Who sends a <unk> text.
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored at at least six months, and until two years, in their phone company or your Internet <unk>
And all over Europe and people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out in the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police police in East Asia.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Whenever I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> who in that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for me, would please tell me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask them, and I didn't get a particular answer -- it was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make a lawsuit for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of it, they <unk>
They ate the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
In the meantime, the Supreme Court <unk> I failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a <unk> inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 information lines.
At first I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to be <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open City City, we did this.
This is a visualization for six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the path.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one on the other, and we end up with this great network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate between each other and what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to who, who send him an email to who, who send this email to who, if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, might never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not in fashion.
When you go home, you send to your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information stored from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to give them to remind you that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we need all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one would love the uterus from my mother and not <unk> because my parents were siblings, though they are.
It just happens by accidents, how I came at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of us in this room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you have chosen to be disabled.
Come on.
Christmas Christmas are in the shopping center, driving in circles and <unk>
16 empty empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and P. C. is just one of them.
There are one <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I am a Palestinian woman, Muslim woman, disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might have to do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I want to walk from my house to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe that you're not born.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three younger sisters <unk> I was <unk>
If my three sisters went to the public school, my parents went to the school system, my parents went back to the school system and they were <unk> that I was also out of it, and if we didn't take all the most <unk> <unk> the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic I was using was to hang a dollar in front of me so that we would get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion and have received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arab in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 and still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a slogan of campaign.
The people that I grew up with had no trouble with my faith.
But nevertheless, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot that died of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating -- so I set off the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> He's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends wear <unk> I would too.
And when my friends went through the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't coming.
I was spending my summers out of a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to get them in <unk>
On the summer holidays often my father was trying to <unk> so I drank milk from <unk> and I would drink warm <unk> on the back, and I was standing in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water to me, my eyes, and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the senior cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga I was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can stand in your head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital in <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of Arizona, because I went in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater department.
All of me <unk>
I did all of the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my classes -- and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> too slow in <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at the four <unk> At the end of it will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it. By the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get a piece of paper.  You got it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the head of the theater department, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask him why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the stunt stunt stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts for risk, you can't do it either.
It was a role for the one that was literally born and was given to an actor.
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
At home, I went back home, and my first tour, <unk> was kind of extra <unk>
My dream became reality.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> <unk> actors, actors, <unk> <unk>
You just take perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I became <unk>
In my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he went high-speed to the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral palsy,
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find a lot of fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight against the stigma challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by the wire he has Keith <unk>
I went back to a graduate dance, I went back to a study and sat at me in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "You can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the host desk so that I don't get rolling off the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, was <unk>
By the end I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't come to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was just like he was <unk> and he hit my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never get away from me and a little girl or old as well.
Suddenly, my disability disability became an object of <unk>
I would see video clips with comments like, "Why do you work?"
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What's the disease that?
We really should pray for her."
One <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't do somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the -- Yes, <unk> man. Come on.
We have been the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the entertainment world.
The doctors were saying they didn't go -- but I'm here in front of you.
However, we've grown with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images that would be more positive -- that would be less <unk>
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> through the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of Susan <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world -- <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the Palestinian refugee children, a tiniest little bit of what my parents <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me acting in alive, and I put this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I would like to tell you a story about a little boy in a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives a small village to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there is no job, no <unk>
He ends up living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you read a guy who offers to take it to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
Let's go to a dynamic group of people, who gives a break.
It gets a little money to buy your new clothes, money to send home to your family.
I show a young boy.
I finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That little boy in that small village with dreams of the great city was the German terrorist terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were in the <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little kid in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for a chance, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came back.
This was the first thing that he took it out of what we call "the <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> young American urban who lived in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the opportunity is the opportunity for jobs, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffer from highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities -- the story of the <unk> the door to the access of access to violence, to violence, to be the story of cities 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work at school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, what if I had never gone?
And if I had seen myself forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders at a business summit
I hired about 90 youth leaders, <unk>
We sat down, and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, that because I was a graduate graduate college student, frustrated, was the perfect perfect for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to point B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
He saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorcycle residents who normally couldn't afford to.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of bike over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the spirit of corporate spirit, and I believe that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people are going to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking so long.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was reluctant to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the overseas.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies are working on the creation of the first public <unk> park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, the young people, they can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink <unk>
And by the way, he's not <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at his city as a place of opportunity.
So encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We have business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people to create a culture of spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their reality.
They need expertise and guidance to <unk> in development and put it out of their business.
We engage the young people with the resources that they need, and they <unk> the support that need to move from conception to the creation, and create the <unk> for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their <unk> <unk> that's how it calls it when it's created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired children on the street to help rent and keep the bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in upstate New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was making the sheets of <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the path that we could -- we almost could pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful lens to a beautiful lens when I discovered something awful.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls and <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy as to pull out what they had <unk> who thought I was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and he got a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you get the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our garbage, it's about 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his trajectories and interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go into more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now not just was traveling in the trucks. I was <unk>
And we <unk> the mechanical and bar <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It is there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe -- and in the days where it's very strong you can go very quickly.
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept beating the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of FBI <unk> the waste collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass through all around you.
They just want to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentless <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also a way of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And it's the stigma.
It seems that stigma is especially ironic because I think the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of waste as effective and effective every day, this starts to reach out of their container and their dangers inherent in us in very real ways.
So we had controlled for decades, and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for the new so that the economy engines start to fail when consumption is in danger.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just to point out the relationship.
And then there is what I call our average speed is necessary.
So I mean by just the speed that we used to be used in the contemporary time.
We usually don't care about it, and we have to take our cup of coffee, our <unk> bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> forget about them, because we know there's a work force on the other side that is about it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that might be able to help reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every single day.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you go to it?
And their work allows us to do our own ours.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> our <unk> and that flow should always remain in one way or another.
On one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection collection truck on the street, grabbed my little baby and went down the stairs and there was a man making his journey of paper recycled as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing this particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be OK."
Shortly after that, I started to investigate the waste collection and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times and we have good friends.
I want to believe that he was right. I was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The city waste -- what we think about when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next you see someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, <unk> a moment to get them back.
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture is naturally born of the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects here as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, and my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are a lot of in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because of the <unk> <unk> heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it is a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, what has nothing to do with Africa nor with Ethiopia.
It's a worth of being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really pleased with the old market that is this structure at the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
That's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a <unk> of a number of stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in a much growth area of the city, where most of the buildings we now see in the image, not there.
And it's also between two earlier streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, put all the inputs from the building.
And this spreads out with an <unk> <unk> which creates a space to open air in the building that was supported by its own shape, of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution to <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow air to air air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> that are the windows that leave the air and light from a controlled way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center -- it wasn't what they <unk>
But in fact, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the mall because ultimately there was more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the <unk> but also because it wasn't necessary to have <unk>
So we got certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity is cut almost every day.
So we get a big advantage to put on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which is in a set of water on the inside.
It's expected for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a very large project, the biggest thing that I have, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put attention to the <unk> a <unk> <unk> structure, which was surrounded by a wall with a dozen doors of access connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was expand the streets in existing streets, creating 12 similar <unk> blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of them <unk> in relation to the idea of interconnected lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell cell -- like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, which would be the best orientation for an apartment in climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we make a framework that makes sure most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result of almost a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant, we have all the connections to pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set greater density on higher levels and lower density in the ground down.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as I give the community back the space full space for construction.
It's where all the neighbors -- they can go up and stick and do activities such as running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people change communities and local economies at the same pace growing the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between community and the environment, and they have to connect nature to nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
It had huge amounts of hair very bright hair, and a little <unk> of <unk> cute. It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year, and I was full of <unk> until I had my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at the time after the head of school was a little late and I was stuck in the <unk>
When the coast of the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher <unk>
And then, I did.
<unk> the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
So all the way to --  And I set up the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of these rows of <unk> and I was just a row out of that, just to be there, because it was <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never got paid.
It's that everything was <unk>
I never told me.
But above all, I was reminded of the reason why I bothered myself that this little girl was so small, it was so good for <unk>
The jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The tiles are tiles very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the cause number one <unk> <unk>
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because the novels are like the laboratory that you study them in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know whether it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> would not have <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
I read the lists of reading high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> or <unk> We were <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No <unk> no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost you have all of them.
This year you meet a hundred years of his masterpiece, "In <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> -- mine, all that we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in your <unk>
We forgot about how hard that image.
We forgot about how relentless it is.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> said were as tough as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
It will be very obvious because the <unk> who are reduced to the person to their wish, their <unk> are an <unk> narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being once storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details would you like to put the knife the knife isn't it?
<unk> make all novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure from another, maybe right now."
And it begins to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm fresh that would be detected in his lover -- adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in his private motion.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break through it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it an emotion of it. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like a lot of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links good <unk> language with jealousy.
When he is in his <unk> agony of soon listening behind the doors of doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to show that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem to us <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search of the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to <unk> <unk> the more agonizing the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to be -- that makes us suffer, to make a range of feelings much more profound and vital that a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud to write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young woman who was consumed by the idea that his woman was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird about that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion with no cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife was doing with not to realize <unk> behavior.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally spread out with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> do us to look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, take us to make violent acts or illegal acts of <unk>
<unk> are driving us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me in the age of eight, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 years of age was captured by being captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since I was sent <unk> <unk> to itself, for one year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to meet the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge though <unk> Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel at Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> <unk> books that are trying to make the <unk> <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take from your will, and you're going to look at what you have ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- you have your cow <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in the times.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show you the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always felt <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> you need the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it takes it to do it with <unk> in each of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The Six of the Six thousand <unk> once you walk in, <unk> to all of their solution, <unk> it comes back to <unk> and he says, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person at <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is mysterious, isn't it?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute -- it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute is the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it even be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to reach the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> <unk>
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have <unk> to <unk>
Only fiction is the jealousy.
<unk> alone invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> I took <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We are in a great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo Day module.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the surface of the surface is the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization at the time of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a few 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the age of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, of which he walked after the death of Armstrong the past year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at Stanford University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> <unk> Some people ask me why <unk>
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And you might also ask, why is the <unk>
35 years ago, why fly about the <unk>
Why does he play Rice versus <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the point of wonder to the survival of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do that.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list of technological victories for technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew crew flew to 40,000 miles no hour.
From 1970, any human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism of the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we would solve was going to solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure the cancer, or feeding the world's population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that he didn't go to the <unk> tube from the rocket.
I knew this would be the last mission that would be the last mission -- but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that of thinking happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have met us, and they had committed enriched toys, things like <unk> apps and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But they don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious than <unk> from the years when they were <unk> <unk> Microsoft, and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of ideas to create <unk> ideas, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of risk were at their high point without worrying for risk, they preferred small investment investment minute that they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had trouble to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and development of development in the long term, but they have never invested in the development of technologies dedicated to solve big problems because they don't have a straight value right away.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that would be popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely affordable.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties were developing the development of an enhanced energy, providing a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that look like technological, turn out not to be.
We know for a long time that famines are result of failure at the process of food.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are policies that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes give up a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The President Nixon was declared the war on cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some resilient in treatment, and only over the last 10 years seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The difficult problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can have -- but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to figure out the problem, the institutions need to support the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> should really be a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous mythology -- there is no popular mythology of science fiction to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They are so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, is a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should get the trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task -- that I think gives you a clearest idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I turn to think that it can have gone down in some activities or institutions that could have increased others.
I don't have of course.
But I can turn to polls polls and polls of opinion are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the polls of opinion over time, there are no evidence of that.
I mean, the people who are getting married 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, are still inspiring the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago they are still quite <unk> the judges, the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway over.
But is this evidence for enough?
What the polls of opinion are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you're looking at are generic attitudes that people plays when some other questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody else would be told to be <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
I'm probably going to be asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very risky answer.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
It's very rational.
In short, in real life, we tend to deposit confidence.
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel like a kind of a <unk> officer or kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to give you the lecture class, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to engage the good inherent trial in fact to trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
I think it's an stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I hope to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is.
In short, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who are taking their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart objective in this life.
<unk> <unk> or intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is make a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is competent in the raw materials and is responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we could not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends that are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still have not <unk>
But that's what we're doing is what we're going to do before trust.
Trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to.
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and others, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
And I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the civic <unk> to go to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and we found that the system of accountability that is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You may have all of you know the similar examples.
So we <unk> all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we're going to stop being worthy of trust and encouraged the people that we are reliable and if they are able to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the <unk> the simple action, the <unk> which doesn't make it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the confidence, it puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is distinctive because they give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the bases enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't get <unk> for all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to make sure that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That does every day, everywhere, does the ordinary people, the <unk> -- very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks in my socks that I can do it without giving a explanations.
I take them and get it back for the money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you come back vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think that what we're looking at is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers we've been <unk> to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly becoming increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, if I had no <unk>
So I started imagining how to <unk>
I first created this tool that was embedded in digital space, so that when the strong force against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
The designers can make their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool the barriers.
But the two hands stay out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using the entire hands?
In Computer Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a fiber transparent with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, and get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with hands.
As windows and archives have a location in the real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and answer lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are feeding in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make that digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and returned by the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical number.
This imam <unk> acts like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> mechanical mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, and what it means to say that human movements can <unk> and they get to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically and distance and famous takes from Michael Jordan, you can play it as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of the planets, the physics, and unlike <unk> or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating that will change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information will not just show us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to get rid of our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that has been our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed that there was only an accurate way to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be an African Chinese opera, man.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends gave me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was much too much to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class is the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look at another <unk>
No one's around me wanted to hear it. Okay.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books that here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese Chinese life.
And it is not propaganda a <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
I said, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this trap. of guilt <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The meeting with a new culture also gave place to my reading reading habit too.
It makes a lot of perspectives.
For example, at first this map I found it out of place because this is what students in China will learn.
I had never happened, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading isn't something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's to research fields as religion and comparative literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if comparative reading worked for research, why not do it on everyday life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
The <unk> of course, are economic and policies and <unk>
By Buddha, they're all <unk> <unk> fear and duty.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk>
For example, it's through the translation of the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up, a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know it's not going to be happy or powerless never.
Having a dream of sleep is really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its more important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, where the dreams comes from, where happiness comes from.
Until a dream dream can do that for you.
And it's because of books, that today I'm here, happy living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a graduate student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came up to the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on my office in my office and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had a <unk> like a first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could drive it.
But I didn't.
With the stories, that Alex brought me to the <unk> it became easy only to move the head while it was going to make the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> I said, Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work after, you go home -- has children later, to death later.
For makers as Alex and I had plenty of <unk>
But soon after that, my <unk> pushed me pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, it's coming out with guys under the category of the category, <unk> <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they were born.
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel after what they get, but this didn't make the mock Alex <unk> they were a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex being the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of benign <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> all over the place.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think nobody comes to the age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> love a <unk> you remove the dream -- a <unk> I want to see. That's good. <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to the 35 years.
This means that eight of 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give her life has been in order to have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money they <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future partner to 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and it is <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change yourself, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the moment to take care of their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear with often is that there's something called adult development, and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the line of the <unk>
The researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence.
The journalists would give them names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard Cohen said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and you say, "You got another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and <unk> absolutely nothing.
And then all of the days, the intelligent guys like you or your kids and daughters come to my office and they say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not at all. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts going to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts going to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running, and they were <unk> but then at some point around the '30s, turned the music and everybody started sitting at sitting.
I didn't want to be the only one who would sit stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but you don't get older, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of you to start a job, choose a mate, and having two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts showing you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
<unk> <unk> crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You know you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give her a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though I lived in a very difficult, very difficult life had been even more difficult.
They were often often in our <unk> but then they get up and say, "You don't pick your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma came his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he kept seeing the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
He was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who's going to take care of it if you give me <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was actually <unk>
He needed a better life, and I knew this was his chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to sit while the previous decade of Emma was going on.
So for the next couple of weeks, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> of identity.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something which is a investment in what they want to be.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: this: capital of identity creates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to give it to it.
I'm not <unk> today's exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't count, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and to make it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you into the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds limit to whom you know how they think about, how they think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who gets out almost always comes from outside of their nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak ties from friends of friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half -- no, and the weak bonds are the way we <unk> this group.
The half of the work created never <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is a way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For last, but not least, Emma thought you don't choose his family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when I had a partner and there was their own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
You might think that 30 is better enough to sit on your head that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choice to the person that you live right now or <unk> when all on Facebook start walking towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you get it, and that means being so <unk> in love as you're at work.
Your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just going to do that is going to work or kill your time with whatever you go to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in a art museum in the other way.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That work offer him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who alive.
Now, five years later, it's special <unk> of events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
He had a new career, she loves her new family, and I send a letter to me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of haphazard contacts are not <unk>
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to support.
The <unk> are like planes coming from the airport to Los Angeles, which come out somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> a slight <unk> in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, 21 or even 25 or even <unk> a good conversation, a good <unk> a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> who know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> -- not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their identity, get your identity capital, you get their weak divide, choose your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a work that was even more <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics at seventh grade schools in New York schools.
And as any teacher, you know, tests and tests.
I give them tasks.
When the work comes back, it was <unk> grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no scores of I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they were working hard and during time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a psychological perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
Is it the <unk> but what if you have success in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West Academy.
And we're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods -- so what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning results of their <unk>
We partnered with private enterprises, asking yourself, what of these vendors are going to keep their job <unk>
And who's going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, it came a feature as a significant <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it was not I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited about more than a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater likely to get in even when the <unk> in each which I could measure, things like the family income, the results of the tests, even the safety that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for kids at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop the determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a strong job <unk>
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest response is, I don't know.  What I do know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't follow with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly related to or is that we are even related to the current measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by <unk> <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when the kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that's a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I'm going to finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, unless you start to fail, to start all of the new lessons with <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> <unk> is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese character.
From that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering whether I can break down this <unk> so that whoever is to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can be done.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of each character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy to us.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, long enough to read <unk> traffic signals from <unk> to understand the basic idea of web pages.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was shouting at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol of reality is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe that it's the other way that it works.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
the moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors in the old west <unk>
I call these eight characters.
These are building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are <unk> three are <unk>
If a person stretch out their arms, this person is saying, <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a speaker tree is pretty much a <unk>
Remember the <unk>
Two alike together, it gets very hot.
Three alike together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three of them together, are <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a <unk> sun, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where it's a way out of it.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad are the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years, we saw the Oz of Oz together.
The film <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and to bring a magic wand to do.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of an industrial <unk> industrial curriculum.
However, the Oz <unk> was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took for 40 years later with, oddly, another film whose <unk> a metal guy and a <unk> boy would join a girl dressed as a guard <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the <unk> magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician magician <unk>
<unk> are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the Oz <unk> is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
Do you use magical shoes to defeat <unk> created by the computer created by <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Oz <unk> is that the most <unk> and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made Star Wars my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a child.
It's just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of the <unk> had <unk>  So, he slid in the room and he was impressed like a leg and he was behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but it was going to get rid of the whole thing.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be the issues of value, and <unk> and <unk>
It would feel like Luke have a army to <unk> the government?
I did this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How his film? How his film?
We make good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, OK? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force force F, in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to encouragement.
I know by experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really expected the credits really to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is over, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a stupid animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and defend the <unk> of Disney first of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they boys, they are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job teaching girls how to fight the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to protect the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have a few great women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful topic of all times is happening in classic <unk> each of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, eventually came out.
I recommend everyone. It's already available in shops.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's pretty good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passed the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not rooted root and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic scientist, and in the <unk> '80s, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had with a friend about the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you need to do, in the movie, there are more than a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk about each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the kid you like.  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I'm rarely seeing it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> an idea of consensus of what is a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> doesn't happen <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful and painful conversations in this <unk> and is the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Do you go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So they <unk> in numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 films, how many of them believe they have no <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percent that the number of women we've chosen for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a bigger number than this is going to spread this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women says that it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for kids to have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music videos or pornography are closely related to you, but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics -- one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you not do <unk>
They are <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We're <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this <unk> statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as well as <unk> and we hope that we have, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our male kids a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is radically changing.
You've read about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite favorite character on Star Wars <unk> you know what <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anybody, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to get to their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and struggle only and more stories where his work was to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people better and be better people, like the magician magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things I loved it was to look at sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
These are sand covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was transferred to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And eventually when I started studying <unk> I realized that I can see with my own eyes not enough.
Because suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up at about 1.3 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what it took me to use satellite images.
To try a map of the past, I knew I had to see it in a different way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place sitting on the eastern Delta, of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it looks like brown -- but when we use infrared and process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape by the construction materials and the activities of the former Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old <unk> city called <unk>
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire over about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that they were located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as he changed over time, went to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find it at random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians of Egyptians doing <unk> jobs can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take it on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we're looking for the layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of objects in <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years of years that date back from the Empire -- the exact same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and quartz <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the rocks that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation which goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have a evidence of an elite jewelry shop that demonstrates that what's been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but it will rise to the place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also do great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Roman quote -- probably been written in <unk> four years ago:
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas really started in 1984 B.C. at a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search for marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door to <unk>
I'd like to pay you attention to the color of the door, the material that he's made.
Now we took a group of <unk> obese cars.
They are competing with a bike <unk> and they go in direction to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There is bikes that all over the parts, wheels that go on to their side, rays from the wheels that end up in places called the negativity threshold.
The lobby, the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
He's waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue fur, making it on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can go into your mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained their living room.
And already in the room, and doing most of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing and dancing over the middle of the center, singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now you go to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a yellow <unk> path and from the oven. They come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len from "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the hands of <unk> <unk> of the hands of you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few men and a few different ages and different hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, looking at them just once.
We had the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
It takes entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize as fast as the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best memories of <unk>
And I asked her question, <unk> when you realize you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a <unk>
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these memory acts using some old techniques using some ancient techniques in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their addresses, and that medieval academics used used to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing outside the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant English guy, but a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to show Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of paper cards in a national television show.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something, not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad I didn't even remember that I had a problem with <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, a number of treaties on memory was written over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory <unk> <unk> and grown up not a thing as rare as you might look like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their own minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have gone down, and I would say that they've changed have changed us.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where there are still people who are passionate about this idea of a memory <unk> <unk> and grown up is this remarkable competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there is a <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team from University College London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know whether it has brains in some structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive tests, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine, <unk> their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and ways of snow found that in the memory champions of the brain, different parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves the space memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament in the <unk> <unk> is driving as a race race where each year, somebody with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 feet of cards -- <unk> who's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there's a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques that are used to the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox of <unk> <unk> He says this: I tell two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you the word that I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which is <unk>
The person who was told that his name is <unk> <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word as the person he told you that his job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, really doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They wear white hats.
They have flour in their hands.
They do good when they come back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when we got that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up on my feet, and he went up with his memory poem, and it was <unk> and so soon it was, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
They go to everyone.
But not only killed them all, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> stopped outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his mind, I could see where I was sitting every single <unk>
I took the family from the <unk> hand, where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we are not good at remembering names or phone numbers or <unk> <unk> word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you ask them to give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is so likely to be very likely to do it.
But I would bet that if you want to tell you who he was sitting on the horse baby loudspeaker in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and image of images with the things that you want to remember. The more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, the more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it for memory -- in the same way that it would have done it -- if you had been invited to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous <unk> crazy thing, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you see the <unk> of the <unk> He mounted on Mister <unk>
And I'll remember you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they put in the kitchen, and the fourth theme they would talk about would be that weird journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help remember it.
This is how <unk> speakers <unk> their narratives -- not word for the word, which is going to confuse but, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek, which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in its <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with it in it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something wide about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition was a <unk> event.
Really, it is like looking at a lot of people sitting taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets asleep the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit in the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never have hoped I was.
It was fun, because it wasn't just trying to train memory.
What it's actually about doing is to improve more and more and more the ability to create and imagine these pictures, and I think <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some of these <unk> covered with tape leaves only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a competitor of memory.
And I ended up coming back at the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could put it in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers, and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just so just tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles of how the brain works.
And it is not necessary to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> from <unk> to benefit from some insight, about how their minds works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We focus on us deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even shortcuts.
They work because they make us <unk>
They put a kind of deep processing sort of processing -- a kind of complete care that most of them is not going to lie down there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I would -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our <unk> <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to being human in front of us, who walks to our side -- we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even stop in processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex thing, so we just <unk> just a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at home in my parents' town called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time watching television -- so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, and I all come up to me, and every time I got married, and I would come back in a towel all of me.
And I was like this.
He was <unk> not and hated it.
That journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and in areas of areas, but from those emotional connections that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the EPA <unk>  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what you think about it for based on a building built a thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We used it 200 years to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century in America, we used it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are making <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Public Library that ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has a <unk> has this round thing -- has this <unk> columns, red brick -- that they leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the stock values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, came up to another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet and read and share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, be so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the architects who constantly drive new technologies, new new technologies, new solutions for today's life.
We did <unk> we did <unk> and we <unk> so far from the people.
All of the black -- you believe that we feel very good, but we're dead because we have no choice.
We have to go to the other side and get back to these <unk> symbols.
So we are all happy, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, so we start experimenting with <unk> we do the next one back and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we took over the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we zoom in to the '80s, and we start to incorporate those symbols.
It would take the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that I like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added the bake and we use a new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into <unk> which can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes were <unk> won on boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, and we move into the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy. They are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we find memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making <unk> the <unk> again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
We have the <unk> symbols -- now we have new design techniques -- a computer design techniques -- and we find ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that will be applied against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk> you have totally <unk>
Usually the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened to happen.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> academics and public public, were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
The tourism. in Bilbao grew up in a 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms, and <unk> how it's possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media went around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism forms.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same mayors did the world's major mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium, it happened to another star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to move with all of architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
You can take a ship -- you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers from architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before knowing if I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen. Because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media, it starts to <unk> every single time to be in both extreme extremes -- almost in <unk> and actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the audience.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> to something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works on a project that my company ended recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building ended up the building, it was already part of the community, and like drawings looked like the product over, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, became a media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you did from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building is built today, first to the Internet looking for <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded with examples of innovation from innovation, about what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> people from <unk> and tell them that there is no unique answer to what can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words and <unk> words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't take something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get paid by architecture.
That means that the pendulum coming from one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go forward and find proper solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas from what a <unk>
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that they're going to make.
That means that the buildings will be transferred to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a New garage <unk> in Miami Beach, Florida, it also can serve to make sport or <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means three architects can dream of swimming on the East <unk> of New York, and a half a million dollars from the community together around that cause, is no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion as <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we think is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent buildings and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and working together to make better buildings, better buildings, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not only reflected in our society, but they give them a way to the most <unk> spaces of local libraries and homes where we form our children, and the step of the room <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it very typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives himself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do that. And he asked me to think, when's a couple of doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
That's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, although his mom tells him all the time she is <unk> all the days in school, somebody who says it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his friends, or colleagues say, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal teenager, which receives these answers at one of the stages of their most emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing is doing this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, giving it <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected to a continuous way, so young.
As a mother said, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from that are <unk>
This environment, from being always connected to our kids to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no division of life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what's rigged it is.
What is the greatest thing about someone in front of someone in front of what is normal in a spring context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the girls in now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And the trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who are <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see how young people compared to the young.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the Iraq stars in sports, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow up to be healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and others start to be suffering.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and how to taxpayers society and the labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom.
One in five are not attending classes at all days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the tests, season, if you don't think you see it good enough, specifically if you don't think you're at Facebook, <unk> a smaller note on the average of your fellow who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland.
And it turns out irrespective of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be good of course, we're talking about how you see you not how you see it.
The low self-esteem over your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with self-esteem do less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, they engage in more diet healthy than they can take you to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and are in greater risk of depression.
And we think that's why they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol consumption and drugs, diet <unk> surgery, aesthetics, <unk> sexual relationships at ages early and without protection and harm.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, irrespective of whether or they have higher rates of <unk>
Eighty percent of women don't present to a work interview on a day that they don't feel safe with the way you can see.
Think for a moment what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
It will take this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways, the first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect imagery and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many available programs to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of programs would be <unk> without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not just have a positive impact, but also an urgent impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, and friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial starting points for any willing to provide education into body self-esteem than work.
A education is fundamental but facing this problem requires each of us that take the charge in the issue, and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
So the current status of the way women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to count on the contribution of our politicians on hair or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judging people for what they are, not because you see them.
All of us can begin by making it by taking responsibility by the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networks.
We can advise people based on their effort and their actions and not their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, like governments and like businesses, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing their entire person, valuing <unk> diversity, <unk>
We have to put people that really make a difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe they are never going to be who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean to someone in their lives.
Who are you on mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
Her <unk> The <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is two car seats, what would mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, that he told him for not having long legs -- <unk> more skinny, a smaller <unk>
What would it mean for it if we were <unk> this and we would take their potential to that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with images are transferred to us all.
But let's give our kids the truth.
So you know, the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
It empowers self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, become agents of safe change tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the five of November 1990s, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the Rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the African Defense <unk>
They initially declared to be naive, but he was a prisoner for some of the small positions of others, started planning for some of the 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an <unk>
Sadly, the pump of 1993 at the World Trade Center, couldn't be there.
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who had a loving mother, elementary school teacher school <unk> two made everything possible for me to give me happy childhoods.
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims are coming to meet.
And I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all human people, there are always a small fraction of people who are so attached to their convictions that think that you have to use all the possible media for everyone to live like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends he and he explained that in the last weekend, he and some friends, had been going to train him in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the bullet that he shot and gave the little orange light over the goal and for surprise of all, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to others and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
How about my father, maybe son.
All of us, the comment took a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put a <unk> they're <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives North Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to me 20 times that instability during my childhood, not allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to somebody who was already comfortable and going to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class I often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret to avoid being the white. But it's going to be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time was spent on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say, <unk> grow under <unk> wasn't prepared for the real world.
And I was raised opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my thinking, was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on juvenile violence, like I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who had done friendship, was Jewish her.
I took a few days to go out of light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer work when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found people from all sorts of beliefs and all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of the life was taught that <unk> was a sin and for extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I was able to see that several of them were the kinder and less critics who had ever seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, sort of like I would have to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that is a homosexual but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every evening, Jon Stewart made me honest about my <unk> and I helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
At occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was looking at my thinking, and she told me something that will preserve in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who's suffered with endless <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to take to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, which even though I went to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those acts of meaningless acts, like rejection actions of my father.
With this simplicity I put in here as a proof that violence is not inherent at any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
This is a film that is projects in your minds.
This is an incredible movie.
It's in 3D and it has sound <unk> of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your <unk>
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood you project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything online.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each one of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you, you and you.
There's nothing to do more directly.
At least, I know I have an <unk>
I have a certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If you weren't aware of anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that are going to show us what we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
So that to integrate consciousness into science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science is for nature, is objective to objective by nature.
<unk> for nature, is <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the other 20th century, you know, <unk> that vision.
Psychology psychology studying <unk> behavior, neuroscience was a <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
It was about 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of great work that I introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of face or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience is answering some questions that we want it to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are doing and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is this internal movie <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find an explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of the emerging behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they operate the <unk> how they work <unk> are adapting and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how the goal works.
That could be apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions in the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk, how we speak, how we speak, how we talk, all of these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are between easy problems.
But the difficult problem, is the question of why it is that everything is accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, is actually still not a lot to say.
I am an <unk> of my heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that would work. For a long time, I hit the head against the wall looking for a theory of <unk> consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to get rid of this point.
We have a wonderful chain of wonderful explanations -- great. It was used to this, the physics explains the chemistry, the chemistry explains biology -- biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision in the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't really know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, and I think that we need ideas that at first, mad, crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan <unk> who's here has one.
Your crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions to the behaviors of the brain, the behaviors of the brain. And this is a study of everything needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of <unk> purely <unk>
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
So in the time you get there, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
We physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> laws fundamental laws that are <unk> like gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explain in terms of any basic thing.
Instead, they think of them as fundamental, and from there is built the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that electric phenomena can be able to explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, <unk> laws -- so I applied the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws were <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, time, dough, mass, so for a matter of logic, you have to add the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the way to fill scientifically.
So what we need to do is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the timing, the physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want the fundamental laws we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws as simple as we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everybody, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only the human, the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when he thinks "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, it's not.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> some the early precursor of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so crazy?
This is part of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like the others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us -- it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Because there is always information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> as a human, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it with an mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And it's not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a kind of medium integration of information, just as significant enough of consciousness rather important.
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller -- but it's not zero either.
In the theory, there is still going to be a level of consciousness different from zero.
It actually brings a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies it.
As explains Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave you as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the awareness is the one that puts you on fire at the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's there at the center.
This vision, I think, has the potential to fix our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had a conscience, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, to get a lot of hunger.
I think that all right, this tends to transform your dreams, while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> it's not both the fact of consciousness, but its complexity and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has an complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have a fairly serious ethical problem about the ethics of smart computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of the collective collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED Talk, right now we have a TED collective consciousness -- an inner film for this whole group of TED -- different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea, which awareness is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
Vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path towards serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night in the morning.
But I think we finally will find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
It had a very normal, profile.
I went to school, I went to my friends, my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community reward.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She has actually no <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. <unk>
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a win if we take the disability outside the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school -- just after about 20 minutes in the 11th class, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about law enforcement for about good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in wheelchair, they talk about things about them in school?"
Usually in the <unk> classroom.
And it was then when I realized that, this child had had experiences with disability as inspiring objects.
And we don't get it, and it's not the fault. And it's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage with what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?   Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they've been sold the lie that disability is <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
It may be you've seen one, of the girl without the hands of a pencil holding through the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call the <unk>
And I use <unk> porn term -- because it led to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been approached by strange <unk> to express that they believe I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like me if I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name --  And this is <unk>
These images, those images were affecting people with disability with people without disability.
They're there for you to look at them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
We had a few things.
But the things that we have, not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I get confused by called the <unk> social model that tells us that we are more likely because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very upset with him.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They are simply using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to focus on the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold this one that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, you don't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't notice that I'm lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to charge the battery from the mobile phone in the chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that that lies that have been sold to us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad thing: the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stick range has never done that it will become a <unk>
Never.    <unk> to a television screen won't show up the subtitles for <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered not <unk> of nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> for me from bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value real achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child from 11 degree at <unk> is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user interface.
The disability does not make us <unk> but question what you think is to know about it that it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and soccer soccer with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, and so please don't get up.
When people think about it, they think in "Minority Report" and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the game field at 160 percent, blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man 110 pounds told us, trying to hide it with all his being.
I've been there and I can assure you, it's not nice.
And so I had a few videos to show you what Google is going to use under the hull, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine going up on the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
And a little bit, a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that you need to be the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> of the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
They want that experience.
What they want to be in the field, will be their favorite players -- and you've asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that probably many of you already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you the reason for this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, oh my God. Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a roller coaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of the fan of a fan of Adrian across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball on the network?  Or <unk> making a <unk> in <unk>
What will be their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when <unk> and <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to make <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give money.
So, here's a quick review review of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to go.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to your group, and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have <unk> you don't have to worry to forget a <unk>
Or they <unk> the strategy.
They just go out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game <unk>
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view of the <unk> of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already been working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good equipment.
The bad people will have <unk> information.
This is going to give the good teams of bad guys.
So your team of computer will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being <unk>
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
What would be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
Let's take the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left-hand side of your bombsight -- you will get a defense behind you go to <unk> Normally, we don't know it, but the <unk> system is <unk>
They went to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open receptor.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receiver can see in the bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The audience gets mad, and fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
They want to be in the field.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are your actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth?
How much is it worth of a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face and the challenges that we face is all of us.
Thank you.
Recently I was <unk> after 23 years in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years was the country that happened to me, the southern end of the County <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is a globally globally seen by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean -- and its emotional <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who had been able to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is essentially <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and no <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, such that each of them is released from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 100 miles an hour.
<unk> <unk> bones, some of which are vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones that not, normally they fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this method of suicide will realize of the death of the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the cord.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are before they get their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darker time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year as this young man talked to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were giving suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official of the media.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him July 22 last year by receiving a call from a <unk> suicide guy sitting on the <unk> near the center.
And when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an official talking to a Golden <unk> officer.
Jason had only 32 years old, and she had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I'd flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
What she came up with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of evil against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason was asked, "What if you open up the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and she left.
This kind of smart, smart guy, in New Jersey had just had life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the following day, the family rabbi called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had been <unk>
The damage damage of suicide affects a lot of people.
So I was asking you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved him were suicide <unk>
What do you find?
<unk> what about that?
In my experience, you don't just talk to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person who you know how it feels because they probably won't.
You can just be there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you don't have afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is, "Is it in similar circumstances have thought of ending their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of the front can save the life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do with <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he was with his permission and blessing you read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing noticing moments of realizing that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> <unk> of his father in January.
It never came there.
He called the police of <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and told me that the Mike car was below the bridge.
A witness I'd seen you jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day.
Thank you very much for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real <unk> disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge, and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, from 2005, I replied to a radio call by a single suicide bomber on the front sidewalk near the northern tower.
I <unk> my bike.
When I saw me, it crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half after, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
And Kevin decided for his account that day come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
And when Kevin fell back, he was <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it do to <unk> and I was going to give it to hope and life again.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I was left talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother, and I have that card with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to delete <unk> events -- and you're one of the reasons that Kevin continues with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I hired Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We give God for you.
<unk> debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writing, <unk> when I visited the General <unk> at the end of San Francisco that night, you were <unk> like the patient.
I knew I did have it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active <unk>
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story to inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got a poison.
That act, to end their own pain, refuse a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They simply want their own pain <unk>
And usually this is achieved by three things: you sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've answered and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls from suicide of the bridge.
In those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And for that time, I got my hand up at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped from the bridge, and they lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one and the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be used to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There are help. There are hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question asks you how you become in that?
I have to be a single thing in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had since a little girl.
My outside eventually <unk> with my inner truth, with me.
So for complicated reasons, I will go over later, when I look at this photo, and I got it down -- I got the <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all embrace our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or by the beliefs that surround us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this <unk> is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, I was always wearing this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew how to make it <unk>
The gender has always been considered <unk> but now we know that, actually, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never helped me share my story, not because I thought it will be bad, but why the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, dad and a family who take me as I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I was still wearing this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the expense of <unk> and the <unk> And that night, I won in the bathroom, won in <unk> and he won the third <unk> among over 40 candidate
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk>
Not many people can say that their first job was from queen of women's women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> <unk> especially when we went to provinces of the Philippines.
But most importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that he passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk> <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know if you beat the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I would put two <unk> to my name.
She would also accompanied me when I was standing in Thailand to 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities, in Thailand to do the most sophisticated surgeries in Thailand -- sophisticated and secure.
In that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to have surgery before the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity <unk> means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who fled his truth, but that <unk> turned his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we make a global vigil for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who are <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day has no longer <unk> from 20 <unk>
My deepest truth, led me to accept what I am.
Are you going to do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. So first, thank you all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, my family, which itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when I was called and told a few times, their parents couldn't take it, and he took the phone, calling my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's just your gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everyone was assigned to a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes that task will not sometimes have a space that would allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be a space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> societies and tribal societies to the parents generally know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, the National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth a child, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome for his father, nor their mother.
The neighborhood comes from his <unk> to mother and no one to the father.
And a mother became a lot of <unk> for a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets a sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a child, when she <unk> her third daughter, you feel guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother suffering, but the daughter <unk> <unk> when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's left home and the school admits the brothers.
Until the age of 12 years, somehow, has a good life.
Can you be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you lose him to go out of their house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the name of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you put the code of that <unk> honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this <unk> <unk> not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of human members in the family.
So this brother <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of her sisters on behalf of the honor.
And there's a norm more than <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl is supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It is supposed to be silent and that accepts the decisions of your father and her mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you <unk> with an old man -- he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If you have a very young thing, it has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more sons and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same moments of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and it goes on.
They took brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew up, when I was four and a half years old, I was standing in my school.
Can you be wondering, why should I mention the fortune of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies in tribal societies, is a great event for the lives of the child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One University of school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when <unk> the form of tourist <unk> and was in the relative part to the family, couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I was never seen the names of my sisters writing in no document.
That was the reason for the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
And he sat down with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> in his personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've been <unk> all these good values in my school girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, pushed for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation of women in all of political, economic and social.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
They were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, I got up and got up in the right to education.
He wrote a daily newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, he offered her same for the New York Times, and I spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the nine October 2012, 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he told me the ear to my wife -- <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter to your <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't get you <unk>
<unk> the <unk>
They make your life in play for the cause of the truth, for the cause of peace, and because of education, and your daughter got inspired by you and you get <unk>
They both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe harsh headaches because his facial nerve, was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was thrown out by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to go right. Please don't <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the most difficult, and I'm happy to share with you that even though it's an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
He <unk> when he doesn't finish his task.
They fight his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about my special <unk> that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I did not did.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the TED group of Google, where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> the visualization of Google -- but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you hit a brain operation for you.
You're still as smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the sticky sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, over a dozen chemicals every day, because if they didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to make it <unk> to keep alive.
I've been saved by a little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the dose of <unk> because there really isn't a clear map that tells you in <unk>
I started testing different mixes and I was amazed by seeing how small changes in the dose changed dramatically my sense of who I was, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
So a particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and typical doses for a man, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I was thinking all of the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types of people, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out to be an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that he had in front of us, and it just didn't happen like that.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to be <unk> since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I used to think about almost always in images, and that became my key point of reference, how do you get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like similar ways.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the minds works, for me is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right and I've got a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination just to drive the world into the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music in your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is just to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups leading in neuroscience.
They both used <unk> technology, functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The backbone of the brain shows the scan of that same individual as you <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left -- it looks like the difference.
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine to see that same image.
Now, let me share another experiment. This is the lab in Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into the visual <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube while <unk> their brains to create a large pool pool out of the brain reactions to video sequences.
Then they showed them a film with new images new people, new animals, and as long as they had a new <unk>
The computer using just the scan of the scan of the scan to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and the left, the video I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're right near that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at a picture and you can imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scan systems available today, and its resolution is increased as a thousand times over the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and put my electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of them are proposing new projected techniques for images, even I am, <unk> with the recent result of <unk> first we have to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with bigger magnets is with bigger magnets but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets that we make bigger magnets better?
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and frequency radio receptors in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field <unk> <unk> magnetic patterns.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can get in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our rising knowledge over the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid -- but the <unk> and <unk> that I've mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas in direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how are you going to learn to deal with the truths of human thinking.
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, choose one year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will be much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you this night about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet for gay care.
I think we all have <unk>
Their closet might be telling someone for a person for the first time that she loves her, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to lie in your life.
Everything I've been in is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet to be universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side of the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> -- I didn't argue, my armpits, the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> out of my pants <unk> and I would have <unk> my head -- I would just ask me a little boy, "Hey, you're a guy or a <unk>
And they would appear to appear a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I put my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a stop <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother <unk> a cold, looking at her son.
But I wouldn't say anything and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, he was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> dating.
Even an excerpt of the "Vagina <unk>
And then I took my eyes down and I went down and I went down to my backs -- a four-year-old girl with a pink dress -- staring at what is not a challenge for <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a boy or a <unk>
And so I took this very deep back and I got out of <unk> around it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk> pajamas.
OK, I'm more from the kind of girl in a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all -- he just went, "Oh, no. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hardest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how it feels like a <unk>
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons for why I get out of my closet was harder than getting out of his, but this is the thing: how hard is it <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who you've declared in online bank is harder than it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult than to tell your son of five years to get you.
There's no more difficult thing, just there's the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what it is difficult to make us feel better or worse to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make you feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls, a closet for me is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail -- a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the lesbian who was prepared to fight any child in four years that would come in the coffee.
He was frozen because of <unk> <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay <unk> and the move just to move a muscle is the scariest thing I've ever ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I did my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents' friends were known to know me for years.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women would have been <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> us?
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but hopefully I desperately show her support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic you are.
That's how hard conversations follow without being my strong point.
Ask anybody that I have ever met.
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it takes out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no armor but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others need to know that they also know.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, they <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they would maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex things.
You communicate your truth.
They would never be surprised by that.
And some of you can come out safe, <unk> so they have done, but they're never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours them.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet to get a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very <unk> but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen -- an productive example -- it's been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether an underwater can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critique to the pioneers of computing as Alan intelligence.
And so a few years ago, we took a program to try and understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from a <unk> race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth or the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and they can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that you don't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, even at a certain point in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying language mechanism.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be folded adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will address the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the <unk> of <unk> there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different kinds of issues and <unk> together, I said, from a number of years ago, there is an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just a <unk> equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a <unk> strength, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintaining open choices, with a force force, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an impending <unk> future.
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
Memory is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain open.
And so in mind this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human intelligence level.
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should be more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that is that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually arises directly from her?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system where it can be found inside.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play computer games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without the wrong thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to find the <unk>
This balancing ability will have applications for formal robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use applications will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate by pulling opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a model of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation have interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable into a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game game against itself, providing your potential for play.
Here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly constantly keeping the web well around.
This same capacity of network network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of actions, successfully by increasing assets under their management exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of different cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walk upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here is a deep irony.
Let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> work, there was always the concept that if you were to have smart machines, there would be a rebellion <unk>
Machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion to the reverse direction.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all possible future is a most fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise from taking the control, rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask, how do you look for targets <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence -- is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a tipping point in human history, something between the empowerment of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
While the last few years, we have <unk> our knowledge of how it fits the Earth into the context of the universe.
The Kepler NASA mission has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint space intensity when the planets go through them, and they block a little bit of that light that gets us.
The data picked up by Kepler show the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their stem star.
And together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that gets from their <unk>
At his time, this gives clues whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The hottest year, it was the warmer record.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from now now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on to a global scale -- they have very quickly <unk> our course.
But I'm not a scientist in the weather, and I don't know.
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know from our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated this by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> trace their surface to find clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission would take samples from the atmosphere <unk> and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not only short space flight but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these images are <unk> we remind deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a rather terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still stay <unk> places -- compared to Mars.
Even in the hottest and higher places on the Earth, the air is fresh and filled with oxygen and filled with these tropical forests in thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will go down with a big and sad <unk> and the belief of some that Mars will expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly habitable the Earth.
So for a lot of that I want to like the <unk> exploration, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to reach humanity to humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will comment on the party that I will actually have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration, and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are only closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> spaces, we may be able to meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a <unk> experiment.
Many years ago, Enrico Fermi asked her to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence for alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced advanced advanced to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that are going to develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization will be able to save us from ourselves, but <unk> <unk> and <unk> exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to tackle the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the problem even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I had my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where there were <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and all were very closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had a flight early in Europe to the next morning, and I walked from my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but they certainly don't more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, well in spite of the circumstances, I was right there.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain is <unk>
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rate your heart rate and <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk>
And when I got to the counter counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in his place, which was going to happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, you know, the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that, but even a month later, my thoughts didn't know.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come from experts and tries to figure out what it came wrong, right?
In <unk> like <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it <unk> a place for things that are missing easily.
This sounds common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science supporting this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make an track of the important things, where it's all right, where the fish are, where the fish are <unk> where tribes live, and my friends live.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
That's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find your nuts.
And if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, <unk> and <unk>
So at home, I got a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your <unk> a <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you turn out a place and you have fun with it -- your stuff will always be there when you get them.
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your credit card cards from your credit card, license, <unk> <unk> for yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of the practical practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> to all decision-making, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions and any kind of decision that we need to take away from a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the outcome of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit of <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of heart disease, heart attack on the heart.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard of the <unk> and he knows it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today is even likely that you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> the <unk>
But there is a question that you must do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most doctors don't want to speak and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to be undergoing surgery in any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic of statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not about the doctor, and if it's somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't really understood the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it off before they help one person?
300.
This is by the research of cynical researchers -- <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently by <unk>
I'm <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one probability for you to lower my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> <unk> the recipe for all of us.
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced by five percent of the patients.
And these things include muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The Five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
And remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So you think about how you do this over time, so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug for the drug that will help you.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic makes it need, is part of the beginning of informed consent principle.
We have access to this kind of information to start about the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the biggest men in the '50s, <unk> prostate prostate cancer, the number needs to deal with is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has occurred.
And the side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before the questions that you can argue that we hold the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter <unk> life of pain, or a long life that might have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react to them with fast.
Unfortunately, one of the things that is going on the window during those moments of stress that is the kind of rational thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to be able to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is recognizing that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail once in a while.
The idea is to think about the future of how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent things that are bad in the first place.
<unk> the night night in Montreal, when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> <unk> along the door, with a key door to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots and lots of cards that I have not <unk> and lots of email messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade of 1800, and over the time of time, it was mixed with local signs, and it got a language that we know today as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
And I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true at all.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really they're in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it is like I lived in a foreign country, and they followed blindly their rules, including behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do I understand the sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I have learned, for example.
"You don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of <unk> <unk>
"You don't <unk> and when you're eating, you don't have the covered in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound of the sound, which is for coming next.
This drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> for going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In the culture, the movement is the equivalent of sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to make it with my thumb -- it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four drawings on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an art house there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I went to museums and <unk> spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
Is it going to tell me more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not just experiences through the ears.
I can feel that <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and get it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could tell you.
I chose to tell me.
There's massive culture around the spoken language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is as if it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
That way I'm able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask <unk> your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value -- something like taking a loan to a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that it might be <unk> in the <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express on paper.
And the same can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning both of the signals as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide into a lot of different <unk>
If you cut a different <unk> for every finger while the piano is lost, like facial expression, the speed of the body, the speed, the speed, the shape of your hand, while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get a button at the same time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers in order to express a concept of clear or idea of <unk>
If only a sandwich would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning of meaning.
Same thing about music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is on that."
This is the sign of it in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I'm <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you cut it back over and again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and put it in.
This is <unk>
If you look at it, and you look at the visually speed -- look like a piece of music.
Everybody day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk>
Sorry tonight."
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is both closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is a lot of <unk>
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk>
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> E, <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands on it.
Now we're going to do it as much in your head and my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Now look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest. But they pass very different meanings on it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very controversial world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't automatically have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines the social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> You don't need to hear the music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your ears, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a kid, my parents said, "You can do everything, but then you have to <unk>
It involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults lied to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I became older, I learned that adults also <unk> and they're not very good at cleaning the other people's people.
The time, now I'm an adult and to teach citizen and invention in the <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk around the beach with a lot of garbage.
So as a good citizens, we go through the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of <unk>
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those plastic bits to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and using those enormous boats as well.
So along with my students, under six to 15 years, we dreamed of inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a <unk>
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids very <unk> can also be involved.
And I'm going to tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are really cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we slow it down to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My work is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get it into something that we hope it works.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, only information <unk>
So by using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids are very excited with robots.
Then we made quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we turned off light light and web cameras in accessories and we put it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and for the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture of the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating through the sensor as slowly through the sensor as the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a rough estimate of how much plastic in the water.
I spent this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it to make it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I looked at my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they <unk> with this piece.
A child, maybe maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that a drink is the water in which they were getting rid of the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and oil are also brown color and when everything is, it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we build a first prototype of a <unk> which can be brought through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help you identify what's in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to research a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it took several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the East Coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power station.
And today, according to the reports of an average of 300 tons are still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the majority of the moment, it has safe and it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've become <unk> every year from the accident and independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to take the children.
Of course I didn't get the <unk> the parents didn't know.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Along with them, we discuss the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do after them, strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the <unk> map we introduced <unk> to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And we were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition -- the closest close to the nuclear center until date.
We zoom in up to a mile of nuclear power, and with the air aid of the area -- we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became so much small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical fibers, you can basically build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It is a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> asking things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or can we help in mobility of the current population transforming their standard wheelchair chairs.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So our scientific citizens, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to care for the environment and people, and to actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other one.
One kind of imposes on the environment, the other one has been.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Michelangelo said when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fights for free.
The <unk> was just a tool.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we have all the information needed for each cell to work and to make it happen.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and mass production.
The lines of assembly have <unk> a world of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think of their objects as <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act mostly like <unk> the other mainly as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that moves gradually its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect at work today between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis, and synthesis, are shown in the two screens after me.
My work in its simplest level is about bringing these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and getting down to growth.
You probably ask why now?
Why wasn't it possible for this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where we are doing four disciplines that offers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designing objects, products, structures and tools through scale, large-scale structures -- in diameter with a <unk> base that someday didn't really be able to print <unk> buildings, and <unk> graphics and <unk> made of genetically altered <unk>
Here we have <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where each <unk> is <unk> to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion <unk> in Paris with <unk> van <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing collaborator we printed this layer and 3D skirt without the cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull combined <unk> and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution of high resolution and <unk> instruments that allow them to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair a chair at the same structural structural chair, and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of <unk> <unk> it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, changes its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk>
But it's the nature of <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Guttenberg Bible, and one of them was left and got to define a lot of what it matters.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> tree.
For that first tree, there would be no difference between trunk, which would have no difference between trunk, which leaves the leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of <unk>
Instead, land did grow trees with branches, <unk> springs and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design if objects were made of one piece?
It was a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material that was <unk> the type of material from the tree <unk> with fruit and found it.
The second <unk> the most abundant of the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, crabs, and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune into their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk> -- <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, <unk> and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material over the march and create these structures made of a single three material material, 100 percent recyclable material.
When the pieces are ready, you just let them dry it to find a natural way to touch with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process of being used to contain <unk> <unk> which first showed up on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to catch little carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> cells, and if it broadens even further.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: <unk> things designed to make it up in the sea, and they raise the <unk> life and put it on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control the flow.
So as the Blank <unk> we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We made our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is the <unk>
She lives in our oceans and on the ponds of fresh water.
And the second is E. <unk> the bacteria that live in the human intestine in the human gut human.
One turns to sugar, the other takes sugar and produces biofuels to the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never get <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
So in order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the fossil tract -- that will help flow these bacteria and to address their function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality itself.
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> more <unk> channels.
This digestive system <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it's 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut intestine just one.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> channels <unk> bright channels in your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are fashion creatures, only half is <unk>
What if the design is <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> our skin <unk> our skin <unk> and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you must always go back to nature.
So for now, you know that a 3D printer prints in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture in which they were <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts like a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers to each other.
And this is happening through scales.
The silk worm first turns into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a worm worm to <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of <unk>
However, when you put silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realize that we have a flat, and <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts of different parts -- and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> were transmitted directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms to death in their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates can be able to shape <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we expand this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that the silk worms went back to the darkest areas and so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, and <unk> the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> silk worms to make silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to be prepared with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and while they were <unk> <unk> <unk> put eggs, and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk.
And in some more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
An silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a design inspired by nature inspired by the design, which demands us, for the first time, that we make us care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
Can you stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be about <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be about <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and working websites -- also playing the guitar in a punk punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And I usually like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of boredom, this feeling of, it's no longer a challenge, it gets <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I get confused by something else, something totally different, and I get stuck in it, and I let me absorb and I feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, spreading all of my own passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not <unk> at all.
I was worried to be afraid of engagement, or being densities, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to give you back then.
Ask yourself, where you learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal meaning to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, they learned about culture.
Can you ask ourselves, "What do you want to be about <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what they were going to do?
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in children like, <unk> or <unk> or whether I want to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> students are asked to pick them up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be about <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what the sleep takes us?
Why?
If this issue is inspired by children to dream of what they might be, not inspires to dream of everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, in fact, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though they're <unk> and say, "Oh, how nice, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>   and he is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this was Amy <unk> editor turned in <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
This is this idea of fate or real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and a lot of different things that wants to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel like that.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And you feel something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath to say.
It could help if you divide into three <unk> <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the timing of the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own one.
It seems to me as a species of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or <unk> that you should win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, and I travel, math and design, <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates the inspired jewelry company.
<unk> and Rachel came up with this very unique idea of his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background -- can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower -- it's fast learning.
When we <unk> we get interested in something, we're going to that.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being beginners, because it's been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
Many skills are attached to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and no independent time.
As a child, pianist had an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become in a writer, I was <unk> it was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner, was a financial planner,
He had to learn the coolest mechanics when they were starting their thumb, and this ability to write it helps to write a compelling choice for the editors
<unk> it's a waste of time to go to what you would get to you even if you were the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a whole way that you wouldn't have <unk>
The third superpower superpower -- is adaptability. That is, the ability to transform into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other words, a website, sometimes jazz from Kickstarter, sometimes <unk> and, sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
The journal Magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to engage with the market needs -- the ones that really make it out.
<unk> of ideas, fast learning, three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that might lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to their own themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to cope with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
They got out of the belly knowing because they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be designing lives and careers that are going to be connected to how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> largely helps them to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said that, if there is one thing you take out of this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with your inner wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart of your heart, then you sell for all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just given to be one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> at intersections.
<unk> our wiring wiring is led to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman called <unk> and brought it to a psychiatric producer at <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even most amazing thing.
If you had to have been alive today, we couldn't give it more help than he was <unk> he gave him a few years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress on Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of two of two.
In other words, there is the probability of their years to go through Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be loved with Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs per rise of five times in 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little of <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be <unk> or even slow their development.
We understand less Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money on the research of it.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in Alzheimer's cancer that in Alzheimer's despite the fact that the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and more causes more than Alzheimer's and causes a similar year of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but the whole world is <unk> Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, we have all of us -- it's all of the scientists, Alzheimer's scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy old brain compared to the one Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds up as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these dots -- they end up on the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots go wrong, and some dots left out there.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and identifying what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You put a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we can do it, and then create a drug that is done.
Until recently, the wires have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some videos from what happened when these drugs were going to be able to test these drugs.
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have a protein molecules that are placed in each other, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result but research like this sample that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it grows that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to <unk> that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we manage it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry, for scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move forward in the late 1980s.
Today, we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's disease often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden, caregivers of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not mostly a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> speaking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I posted this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, it does this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience as we try to test it myself at the time of the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will be used to take over 36 questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number three: When was the last time you hit another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number two: <unk> really <unk> me, Tell your partner to your partner what you like to her, or it does it, I know that you don't say that you don't say somebody you've ever met.
When I first came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I was able to test this study, with someone who knew don't particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
But nevertheless, we were <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the spinal cord a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's August, so I guess some of you might probably ask, do they still go on, still <unk>
And the reason I think this is why I think this is because I've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the article was <unk> I was <unk>
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been encouraged to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times reaches probably a few thousand views.
And that had a good charge of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and already Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And on Sunday, I had already called me today: Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was saying something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing honestly about your own experience, but another thing is to discover that life loving one has been international news --  and people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, they asked first the same question: still are you still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
And I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
And I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk>
The 36 people seemed to have <unk> life <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> which included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both did a public emergence together.
We had TV and TV interviews, and <unk> <unk> for pictures of us two.
I think that I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if I was able to make love -- they were able to produce <unk> not just an adventure, but love, real love, <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel like to answer me.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, mostly that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you were going to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this particular study in 1997. And there the research goal was not producing romantic love.
Instead of that, he was looking foster interpersonal between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
The participants were felt closer after doing that, several later, later studies, they also used <unk> protocol as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of the police and community and have been used by people with <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately he never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> I tried the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say that you get rid of the person who you do it.
Well he did a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better to know better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard separation on it.
He had had that relationship since I had 20, what was probably only my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I was interested in science.
And I did all I was able to find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a certain way to break the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just read for the book that I wrote -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I had the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel back then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what I <unk>
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can tell you that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much as they can demanding to me.
What I'm looking for love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> but that I'm going to keep being <unk> by the person I love.
It can be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the risk, and this is a very controversial story, because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that says, still continue together?
And their content with an answer to an answer or No.
So more than a question, propose that we make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with doubt your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to start to have a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's a known one year, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still get together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same as staying <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper <unk> "Love didn't happen.
<unk> love -- because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was not considered everything that that choice was.
It didn't find how many times we would have to take that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, I'd chosen to love somebody so generous, and kind of fun and expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't know.
And what I'm going to do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the very happy ending implicit in the title of my paper which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really written.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian on full mountain, and in a way I got a <unk> of the forest forest.
So the city of New York does a time.  One thing that really affected me but more details going on.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
So I took a box of wood, and I wrote a dollar, a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some of the strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later, and they would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would be, for example, how we eat spaghetti.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's got grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going out of a field and <unk> and all of those <unk> <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> -- I went down the style of Agnes Martin I covered the covered in resin and a bee stuck in.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and she is <unk> to them, so I put more resin on the canvas, thinking it could be <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite -- in some way it seemed to be growing up, as if it was that they were <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did do? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add some electronic elements, we were strange bottles that I was finding out the street, all I could find out the street, and I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can be drawing in space.
And I can flow out <unk> draw just like a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, you will be able to make an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money to take my girlfriend for for example, to go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form of human forms of the natural size of the natural size of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the <unk> was going to kill.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to drawing on a window, and then another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of three-dimensional composition here.
And this really worked, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was really inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double their face, so it's 10 feet old.
It's a little awkward.
Well, that's the blood source.
The left is Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh -- where it <unk>
This is where creatures with animal heads are heading up at <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a wild god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is at the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look at very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out of it.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a tail of snake <unk> on the <unk>
Anyway, their tail turns on fire on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made from a terrorist card 1986.
They've been <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
All of your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years ago to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries.
But each one acts as a kind of archives in form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They are like cells, they come together, they are <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can get it into the <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue coming in.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, the boxes that we live in.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box called <unk> <unk>
Within this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a museum, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world -- and a garden.
We sell the box and all the people in it <unk> each other like particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion -- not works.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any drug in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take drugs -- they serve the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the credit cells.
But they are also known for their side effects of <unk> in its most negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the stream -- you're going to get worse and worse -- even for the time that it takes to get to its destiny, which is where it's more important -- in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and not easily in the blood stream of patients who are <unk> to regular drugs with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new liver cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a long-term treatment treatment for oral <unk>
And one day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you are used to be used in <unk> for wounds and surgical surgery, you can use it for anything else, including transportation transportation.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, opening up and closing almost immediately HIV cells with HIV to introduce drugs.
You can ask, "How is that <unk>
We ship a small laser beam laser over the cellular membrane of HIV as these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or in plate plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
How is that <unk> <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make a <unk> at the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it goes to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every research researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, Canada, or <unk>
They are doing what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to better understand these agents from violence and studying ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to confrontation not violent.
I do fieldwork in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, from the <unk> negotiating peace deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed between a state and an actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very good about the reasons why they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and the policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian met by their suicide attacks -- against Israel, also runs the Gaza in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking
We would have a complex <unk> of communication stations, radio channels, websites of Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> <unk> magazine, in English and published to <unk>
Local groups also invest in a complex fundraising fund without <unk> but by business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to better recruit and build their brand.
Local groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, put in a professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Local groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state doesn't promote security and protection.
The <unk> of the Taliban in an Afghan Afghanistan for war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups to deliver safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price higher for the population.
But in general, providing social services it means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election was in 2006 from <unk> <unk> cannot be understood without acknowledging the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps <unk> by government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, participate in violent struggle and they have governance.
And the more sophisticated and the sophisticated and the more sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can less <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How to call a group like <unk>
They were part of a territory, running all of their functions, collect the garbage, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the weakest of the states, as in the Middle East -- the more in the Middle East and fill that gap the non-state actors <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in a military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better to <unk> groups we will understand better what incentive will offer to foster violence from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some <unk> but we don't have peace or stability.
To achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that safety emptiness to fill that vacuum emptiness that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the tag tag on <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I was <unk> as a bad feminist label.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews -- people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke -- meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and they hated sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world, and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people to the <unk> which might be a feminist label.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant.
I think of me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
And over time, as I went growing, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and moreover, proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They put the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and the services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account for our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition, skills and much more.
We have to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that it matters in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist label.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music to all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends me deep -- the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
Did you actually come up with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical performance.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects, the collection of trash, <unk> <unk> and <unk> maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and things nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy tales.
Some of my crimes are <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for free."
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I would love that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> Feminism is conventional feminism who has been or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, gay workers, gay and <unk> by <unk> white, <unk> and high school.
I mean, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens like this: <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we hope to perfection.
When we get rid of we take it with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to get myself out of that <unk> before you try to put myself up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> because I'm afraid of what that tag means by fear of not being able to fulfill with a little realistic expectations.
Take an example of <unk> or I call it the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music 2014, in <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to this star at the pop star embracing feminism and making the women and the young men that will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the weather, cultural critics start argument if they <unk> it was or not exactly feminist issue.
<unk> its feminism, rather than simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
It contributes to the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much very <unk>
We go far beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, one feminism more inclusive.
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to be able to provide a human supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are to justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant and also very brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
And they are told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as sports, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the film in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk> <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, engaging in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until his Twitter degree, or organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
These are those of us who are <unk> but we can engage in this kind of projects, we can also help them to be including even more like they are <unk> to overcome the barriers to making decisions.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will go to the top, to people in the power of CEOs and movie producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make huge decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell the bravery our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I mean, most of all, because the ancient voice was <unk> me and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
So some of the kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know the guys can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I'm going to make my voice, and after all I did not help me to believe I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was stuck in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have a brown skin.
I read the words of women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, too, I also found that if it was a little courageous -- another woman could be <unk> and see me and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> reality, which I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I mean and what I do, without abandon everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need a bit of courage.
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because I visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that <unk> that can be fatal to a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is a effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the outbreak <unk> had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly being <unk> even autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that sparked controversial news on autism and vaccines were <unk> and marked by being a fraud <unk> by British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had heard of her creating their entire professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued in stable just three or four children per 10 dollars.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to be <unk>
And hedge fundraising NGOs like <unk> <unk> are often routinely referred to autism as an epidemic, as if I could hit another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Centers for Disease Control what's going on, tend to be based on sentences like <unk> <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young woman who seeks in the face of his son of two years, visual contact.
If the criteria had they had to tell you, why were they so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened to have less to do with the slow and slow progress of the science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how autism was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a infant psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> who describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds -- <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by shaking their faces, but they were prey to panic by <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
Over the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By 1950, as primary authority of the world in the subject, stated that there was seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while <unk> references from places like South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> give that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
It was once <unk> that he had become nine out of 10 children sent out for other doctors to be autistic and without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child psychotic by both cold parents.
These kids, he said, they've kept very carefully on a fridge that we don't know.
At the same time, though, it <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite albums he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were simply telling them what they had heard of their parents rather than to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions to their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought the theory of <unk> mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had an autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as concentration without support, without special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend ourselves from the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a prevalence prevalence of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse and diverse as diverse and diverse in them.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, or dinosaurs or <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful <unk> and <unk> as <unk> and watched a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have had these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he got together buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation to the English but luckily, the <unk> husband was talking German, and he was getting it to her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a boarding school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, and the kids kept their reading games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a disability <unk> of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic like patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education methods that were especially suited for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a different continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, looking at this continuum of this continuum in biblical culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He went beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silently with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis of the diagnosis that we would use the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by one wide and inclusive model of Asperger's
These changes didn't fall on <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between it to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> acting of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards on the <unk> <unk> psychologists and parents from everybody knew what was autism.
At the same time, it was introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect storm of consciousness for autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that they were able to be able to have autism and their families eventually support the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines for the increase in diagnostics. A simple, powerful, <unk> history as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the rate of preventing one in 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
Over the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the new breakthroughs of the new breakthroughs -- the term <unk> to celebrate varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> it's thinking about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows <unk> it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
Certainly autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> for the most autism aspects of autism found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go through an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
